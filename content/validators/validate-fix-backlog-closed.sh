  # Check WAIVED rows have a justification (non-empty cell or paragraph after).

  # (the parent shell still reports exit 0 even though a real gap was
  # written to the gap file and shown in the JSON `items` array).
  #
  # NOTE (T22.19): \b is a no-op on stock macOS /usr/bin/awk (onetrueawk),
  # so /\b(CRITICAL|HIGH)\b/ never fired on this machine (confirmed live:
  # it silently matched neither a false-positive "HIGHLIGHTED" line nor a
  # genuine "| HIGH |" row). has_word() tokenizes on runs of non-word
  # characters ([^[:alnum:]_]+ -- underscore counts as a word char, same
  # as \b) and compares tokens exactly, replicating \b's whole-word
  # semantics without relying on unsupported regex escapes.
  #
  # Also fixed incidentally, found live while verifying the above: the
  # trailing `i` on `/^(WAIVED|WAIVED-WITH-JUSTIFICATION)$/i` was presumably
  # meant as a case-insensitive flag, but onetrueawk has no such regex-literal
  # suffix syntax -- it silently parses as string concatenation of the match
  # result (0/1) with the enclosing for-loop's `i` counter, producing an
  # always-non-empty (hence always-true) string. That made `has_just` almost
  # always 1, so this check could never actually fire regardless of the \b
  # fix above (confirmed live: an empty WAIVED-status cell "matched" the
  # regex before this fix). Dropped the stray `i`; every other status/severity
  # literal in this validator (and this repo's FIX_BACKLOG fixtures) is
  # already upper-case-only, so exact-case matching here is consistent, not
  # a regression.
