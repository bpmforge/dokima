#
# validate-close-receipt.sh -- a ticket module in `in_review`/`done` must have
# the close() receipt pasted verbatim into its Completion Manifest (T26.3).
#
# Root cause this closes: before T26.1, a ticket's completion was a
# self-asserted string ("<id> done -- ...") with no gate ever checking it was
# real. T26.1 fixed the STATUS side (close()'s own verify-gate re-run,
# manifest-must-exist check). This closes the COMPLETION-SIGNAL side: even
# with a real close() call behind it, nothing previously forced the
# resulting receipt to actually land anywhere durable -- an executor could
# run close(), see the receipt print to their terminal, and then still just
# write "<id> done -- ..." in the manifest without ever pasting the receipt.
# accept() (scripts/lib/tickets-lifecycle.mjs) now refuses in_review -> done
# without it; this validator is the same check exposed for the gate sweep /
# a standalone fixture-provable acceptance test, via `tickets.mjs
# check-receipt` (single source of truth: manifestHasCloseReceipt()).
#
# Deliberately NOT chained into validate-phase-gate.sh's GATE_VALIDATORS --
# the module-ticket layer (plan.json's modules[]) is an orthogonal axis to
# the 5-phase SDLC doc pipeline that GATE_VALIDATORS gates, and accept()
# itself is the load-bearing enforcement point (this script cannot be
# bypassed the way a phase-gate validator that's merely "run before merge"
# can -- accept() runs it every time, in-process). Kept as a standalone
# script (with red/green fixtures, T26.3's planted acceptance test) so the
# gate sweep and CI can still assert the rejection actually fires.
#
# Only checks modules already in_review or done -- a module still
# claimed/in_progress/ready/blocked has no receipt to check yet; that's not
# a gap, there is simply nothing to verify.
#
# Usage: validate-close-receipt.sh [project-root] [plan.json]
# Exit 0 clean / 1 gaps / 2 error.
