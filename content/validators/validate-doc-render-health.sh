# validate-doc-render-health.sh -- markdown-table orphan-fragment linter
# (T29.9, H8/C-2/C-3).
#
# This repo's published docs have twice suffered real, observed rendering
# bugs that look "fine" in a plain-text diff but are genuinely broken once
# rendered: (1) a Mermaid node label containing an unescaped backtick, which
# breaks the Mermaid parser and makes the rendering tool silently fall back
# to showing the raw ```mermaid code block; (2) a markdown table where a
# data row is not preceded (in the same contiguous block) by a valid
# header + separator row, which renders as an orphaned pipe-delimited text
# fragment instead of a table in most Markdown renderers.
#
# Split of responsibility (deliberate, not accidental duplication):
#   - Mermaid diagram health (including the backtick bug, M013) lives in
#     validate-mermaid.sh, which already owns Mermaid fence-tracking and
#     label parsing -- extending it kept one parser instead of two.
#   - THIS validator owns the markdown-table half, which is not
#     Mermaid-specific at all (it applies to any ordinary markdown table).
# Both are chained together in validate-phase-gate.sh's doc-hygiene set, so
# together they form the "render-health" gate the ticket describes: every
# diagram renders as a diagram (validate-mermaid.sh), every table renders as
# a table (this validator).
#
# Table-orphan-fragment check:
#   A contiguous run of `|`-delimited lines (no blank line, no fence
#   boundary in between) is only a valid table if its first line is a
#   header row and its SECOND line is a valid separator row (cells made up
#   only of `-`, `:`, and whitespace, e.g. `|---|---|` or `| :-- | --: |`).
#   A run that doesn't satisfy that -- a lone data row after a blank line
#   with no header above it, or a run whose second line isn't a real
#   separator -- renders as literal pipe-delimited text in most renderers.
#   Runs inside fenced code blocks (```...```, including ```mermaid) are
#   skipped entirely -- a shell pipe in a code sample is not a table.
#
# Usage:
#   validate-doc-render-health.sh [project-root] [scan-path]
#   Defaults: project-root=$(pwd), scan-path=project-root/docs (falls back
#   to project-root itself if no docs/ dir -- same convention as
#   validate-mermaid.sh, so fixture dirs without a docs/ subdir still scan).
#
# Exit: 0 = clean, 1 = gaps found, 2 = validator error

# shellcheck disable=SC1091
