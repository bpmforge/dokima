# validate-persistence-block.sh -- executor/coding agents must carry the
# anti-announce-then-stop rule (agents/shared/PERSISTENCE.md).
#
# The #1 accidental pause: a model announces "I'll now edit X" and ends the turn
# with no tool call, so the runtime legitimately ends the loop. The prompt-side
# fix (OpenAI persistence reminder, ~+20% SWE-bench) is PERSISTENCE.md. This
# validator ensures every agent that does tool-heavy execution or emits
# delegation actually carries the rule -- directly, or transitively through a
# shared contract that embeds it (MODEL_ADAPTER / BOUNDED_TASK_CONTRACT), or by
# stating the rule inline. Prose-only rules drift; this holds (same lesson as
# validate-handoff-discipline.sh).
#
# Usage: validate-persistence-block.sh [project-root]
# Exit 0 clean / 1 gaps / 2 error.
