#
# validate-completion-manifest.sh -- confirm a HANDOFF completion manifest has
# the required sections AND that its claims are actually true (T27.2 v2).
#
# v1 only checked schema (do the required headings exist). That closes
# "cannot be faked by omission" but not "cannot be faked by content" -- a
# manifest could claim files that were never written, or "tests pass" with
# nothing to check that against, and v1 would happily pass it. v2 adds three
# objective, deterministic checks on top of the v1 schema check:
#
#   1. Every path cited in "Files produced" must exist on disk.
#   2. "Verify result" must cite at least one concrete artifact path (a test
#      log, a receipt, a VERIFY_*.md, etc) and every cited path must exist.
#      This is a receipt-CHECK, not a re-run: re-executing an arbitrary
#      command string extracted from prose is both an injection vector and
#      non-reproducible in this validator's context, so v2 deliberately
#      checks "the evidence you cited is real" rather than "re-derive the
#      evidence yourself."
#   3. The manifest must declare Maker: and Verifier: identity lines, and
#      they must differ (trim+lowercase compared, same normalization as
#      scripts/lib/tickets-lifecycle.mjs's sameActor() and waive-gate.sh) --
#      self-verification defeats the entire point of a verify step.
#
# None of this proves the CONTENT is truthful (a fabricated file with real
# content still exists; a cited receipt could itself be stale) -- that's
# CHALLENGER_PROTOCOL.md's job (veracity), not this validator's (existence).
# What v2 closes is the cheaper, more common failure: claiming an artifact
# that was simply never produced.
#
# Known limitation (independent review, 2026-07-08): path extraction
# requires a backtick-quoted token containing "/". A root-level bare
# filename with no slash (`` `test.log` ``) is invisible to the extractor
# and can't be checked; a non-file backtick reference that happens to
# contain a slash (a URL like `` `https://example.com/docs` ``) is treated
# as a path candidate and false-positives as file-not-found. Both are
# accepted asymmetric tradeoffs of a cheap grep-based extractor, not a
# real parser -- fails toward stricter (URL) in one direction and toward
# permissive (bare filename) in the other, rather than either uniformly.
#

#   - Files produced
#   - Decisions (or Decisions made)
#   - Known issues (or Deferred)
