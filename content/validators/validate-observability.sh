# validate-observability.sh -- the observability spec must be concrete at
# Phase 3, not "we'll add monitoring later."
#
# validate-infrastructure.sh checks that the Operational Concerns SECTION
# exists; this validator checks the observability CONTENT inside
# INFRASTRUCTURE.md (or a dedicated docs/OBSERVABILITY.md if present):
#
#   logging    — a stated strategy (structured/centralized + retention)
#   metrics    — a named methodology (RED, USE, or four golden signals)
#                or explicit metric names
#   tracing    — distributed tracing position (required for multi-service
#                topologies; "N/A — single service" is acceptable)
#   alerting   — what triggers an alert (thresholds/conditions, not just
#                a tool name)
#   dashboards — what is on the primary dashboard
#
# Exit: 0 = spec complete / 1 = gaps / 2 = invocation error
