#
# run-handoff-gates.sh — automated gate chain after a HANDOFF returns.
#
# Replaces the orchestrator's manual "read the manifest and decide" step with
# deterministic validators. Called by sdlc-lead from the resume protocol.
#
# Gates (in order; any failure aborts the rest):
#   1. Scope    — git writes confined to assigned directories
#   2. Manifest — completion manifest schema valid AND claims checked against
#                 disk (T27.2 v2: files exist, verify cites a real artifact,
#                 maker != verifier)
#   3. Coverage — domain-specific validator (optional)
#   4. Tracker  — tracker-worthy work changed a tracker file (T27.2). Compared
#                 against the branch point (--since), NOT the working tree.
#                 Per-step-against-HEAD was the original design and it was
#                 wrong: in an SDLC run the tree holds other steps' uncommitted
#                 deliverables while this step's tracker is already committed,
#                 so the gate fails on a tracker that WAS updated. See the
#                 comment at the gate itself.
#   5. Runtime  — build + lint + file size (optional, --runtime flag;
#                 coding-agent HANDOFFs). File size is checked per-HANDOFF
#                 rather than only at the phase-4 gate because monoliths
#                 accrete across tickets — see the comment at the gate.
#
# Usage:
#   run-handoff-gates.sh \
#     --scope <dir1> [--scope <dir2> ...] \
#     --manifest <path> \
#     [--coverage <validator-name>] \
#     [--root <project-root>]
#
# Examples:
#   # Standard HANDOFF — scope + manifest only
#   run-handoff-gates.sh --scope src/auth --manifest docs/reviews/MANIFEST_auth_2026-04-24.md
#
#   # Architecture HANDOFF — also run coverage
#   run-handoff-gates.sh --scope docs \
#     --manifest docs/reviews/MANIFEST_arch_2026-04-24.md \
#     --coverage validate-architecture.sh
#
#   # Parallel wave — check per-module
#   run-handoff-gates.sh --scope src/auth --scope tests/auth \
#     --manifest docs/reviews/MANIFEST_auth_2026-04-24.md \
#     --coverage validate-api-coverage.sh
#
# Exit: 0 all gates pass / 1 one or more gates fail / 2 invocation error

# ── Gate 4: tracker (T27.2) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Per-step mode was WRONG here and blocked real work for a day. It compares the
# working tree against HEAD on the assumption that the tree is the returning
# HANDOFF's own uncommitted footprint. In an SDLC run it is not: handoffs share
# docs/work/ and docs/reviews/, deliverables from earlier steps sit uncommitted,
# and a git-expert checkpoint commits the tracker. The tracker then vanishes
# from `git diff HEAD` while 100+ unrelated dirty files remain, so the gate
# reports "no tracker updated" about a tracker that was updated and committed
# minutes earlier -- with nothing this step can edit to clear it. handoff-done.sh
# requiring a step to COMMIT what it owns is precisely what triggers it.
#
# Scoping to --scope does not help: the shared directories ARE the scope.
# So compare against the branch point instead, where the committed trackers
# actually are. The per-step question ("did THIS step record itself?") is
# already answered, correctly scoped, by the manifest gate above --
# validate-completion-manifest.sh enforces the mandatory `Tracker updated:`
# line. This gate's distinct job is the physical one: a tracker file really
# changed somewhere in this run, not merely that a manifest claimed it.
