# validate-doc-counts.sh -- docs must not claim a stale count.
#
# release-manager step 5 ("re-derive every count claimed in README/docs from the
# filesystem") was agent-only prose -- a manual release (git tag / gh release
# without dispatching release-manager) bypassed it, and "48 validators" drifted
# to a real 53 unnoticed. This makes that audit a deterministic gate: for each
# countable artifact directory that exists, re-derive the count and fail any
# "<N> <noun>" claim in README/docs that disagrees.
#
# Generalizable-safe: a project without these conventional dirs simply has
# nothing to check (clean). Wire it into the merge gate when README/docs change.
#
# Usage: validate-doc-counts.sh [project-root]
# Exit 0 clean / 1 gaps / 2 error.
