# validate-qa-evidence.sh -- enforces that a qa-vnv-engineer V&V report is
# EVIDENCE-backed, not prose. The whole thesis of the QA/V&V discipline is
# "measure, don't eyeball" -- so a report with no traceability and no attached
# artifacts is a gap, however confident its wording.
#
# Skips clean when there is no V&V report yet (nothing to validate) -- same
# graceful-fallback shape as validate-design-tokens.sh.
#
# Checks (against the newest docs/testing/vnv/VNV_REPORT_*.md):
#   1. A V&V report exists                        -> else skip clean
#   2. Report has a Traceability matrix section   (requirement -> test -> evidence)
#   3. Report has an Exit-criteria scorecard
#   4. Report names an evidence bundle directory  AND that dir is non-empty
#   5. Report contains at least one measured finding (a number: px / :1 / % / rect)
#      -- guards against adjective-only "looks fine" findings
