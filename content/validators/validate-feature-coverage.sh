# Inventory = source files changed on this branch vs the merge-base with the
# default branch. Coverage = every changed source file is mentioned in at least
# one review artifact under docs/reviews/ (CODE_REVIEW / SECURITY / PERF /
# UX_REVIEW / FIX_BACKLOG). A changed file no reviewer mentions is a gap.
#
# Used by run-coverage-loop.sh with the `feature` phase (2-iteration cap).
