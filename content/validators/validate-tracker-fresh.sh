#
# validate-tracker-fresh.sh -- tracking-as-gate (G-D).
#
# "Things get lost as we work through the steps." The fix: a step cannot finish
# with real work changed but NO tracker updated. This gate compares the git
# working tree against a known set of tracker files — if work files changed but
# none of the trackers did, the work is at risk of being lost between steps /
# sessions, so it FAILS until the tracker records it.
#
# Git-based, so it cannot be faked the way a manifest line can ("Tracker updated:
# yes" with no actual change). A step that genuinely touches no tracker-worthy
# work (e.g. a pure tracker edit) passes.
#
# Trackers (any one satisfies): SDLC_TRACKER.md, PROGRESS.md, DELEGATION_LOG.md,
# CHANGELOG.md, *_TRACKER.md, LESSONS.md.
#
# Usage: validate-tracker-fresh.sh [project-root]
# Exit 0 clean / 1 gaps / 2 error.
