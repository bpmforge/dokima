# validate-tracker-fresh.sh -- tracking-as-gate (G-D).
#
# "Things get lost as we work through the steps." The fix: a step cannot finish
# with real work changed but NO tracker updated. This gate compares the git
# working tree against a known set of tracker files — if work files changed but
# none of the trackers did, the work is at risk of being lost between steps /
# sessions, so it FAILS until the tracker records it.
#
# Git-based, so it cannot be faked the way a manifest line can ("Tracker updated:
# yes" with no actual change). A step that genuinely touches no tracker-worthy
# work (e.g. a pure tracker edit) passes.
#
# Trackers (any one satisfies): SDLC_TRACKER.md, PROGRESS.md, DELEGATION_LOG.md,
# CHANGELOG.md, *_TRACKER.md, LESSONS.md.
#
# Usage: validate-tracker-fresh.sh [project-root]
# Exit 0 clean / 1 gaps / 2 error.

# --base <ref>  -> merge-gate mode: compare the branch against <ref> (e.g. main).
# --since <ref> -> handoff mode: commits in <ref>..HEAD UNION the working tree.
# default       -> per-step mode: compare the working tree against HEAD.
#
# Why --since exists. Per-step mode assumes the working tree IS one step's
# footprint. That holds for a single agent working alone; it breaks in an SDLC
# run, where handoffs share docs/work/ and docs/reviews/ and a git-expert
# checkpoint commits the tracker while other steps' deliverables stay dirty.
# The tracker then disappears from `git diff HEAD` while the work does not, so
# the gate reports "work changed but NO tracker updated" about a tracker that
# WAS updated -- and no edit can clear it, because the dirty files belong to
# other steps. Worse, handoff-done.sh requires a step to COMMIT what it owns,
# so obeying that contract is what makes this gate unsatisfiable.
# --since restores the intended meaning by counting the branch's commits too:
# a tracker committed during this run still counts as updated.
