# validate-requirement-closure.sh -- Phase 4->5 REQUIREMENT closure gate (T29.2,
# H1/A-6.3).
#
# Root cause this closes: task closure (every module ticket status "done")
# was silently standing in for requirement closure (every user story actually
# delivered) -- ModuleTicket had no requirement/story field at all, so
# story<->ticket linkage was structurally impossible and a plan could show
# 100% modules done while a real story was never claimed by anything. This
# validator computes requirement closure INDEPENDENTLY of task closure via
# two checks:
#   1. requirementClosure() (scripts/lib/tickets-graph.mjs): a story is
#      closed only when >=1 module references it (stories[]) AND every
#      referencing module is "done". An unmapped story fails this even when
#      every module in the plan is done -- the ticket's red-fixture scenario.
#   2. The mandatory reconciliation matrix (docs/work/REQUIREMENT_RECONCILIATION.md,
#      Template 11 in agents/shared/HANDOFF_TEMPLATES.md): a human/agent looks
#      at the actual code (not the ticket's self-reported status) and records
#      DONE/PARTIAL/OUTSTANDING per story. Required as Phase-5 input -- a
#      missing row or an OUTSTANDING verdict fails the gate; PARTIAL does not
#      (disclosed-partial is not the defect this closes; silently-unreconciled
#      is).
#
# Skips cleanly (nothing to check) when the stories[] layer isn't adopted at
# all -- this is an additive layer, same posture as validate-tickets.sh's own
# "no module tickets" skip.
#
# Usage: validate-requirement-closure.sh [project-root] [plan.json]
# Exit 0 clean / 1 gaps / 2 error.
