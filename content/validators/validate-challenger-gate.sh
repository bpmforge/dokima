#
# validate-challenger-gate.sh -- any FIX_BACKLOG/review/security report
# containing a HIGH or CRITICAL finding requires a matching
# docs/reviews/CHALLENGE_REPORT_*.md, and every challenge report found must
# show zero unresolved CONTRADICTED verdicts (T27.3).
#
# T29.5 extension: a second, independent source category feeds the SAME
# SOURCE_HITS collection and the SAME correlation mechanism below (per-source
# Artifact-field matching, T22.20) -- an ASSERTED EXTERNAL RATIONALE (a claim
# that an outside compliance/supply-chain/legal/vendor mandate forces a
# hard-to-reverse architecture choice) is exactly the kind of unverified
# factual claim this gate exists to police, so it is treated as a source
# requiring a matching challenge report, not a parallel gate. The marker is
# the literal string "**External rationale (needs verification):**" (see
# references/adr-template.md) found in docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, docs/TECH_STACK.md,
# or any docs/adrs/*.md (or docs/architecture/decisions/*.md) file -- the
# ADR_DIR resolution mirrors validate-adrs.sh exactly, on purpose (same
# convention, not a second one). A researcher FACT CHECK's own RESEARCH_*.md
# output going through ITS OWN Challenger Gate does NOT satisfy this --
# per T22.20 correlation, only a challenge report whose Artifact field names
# THIS source (the ADR/design doc) counts; a challenge report that only
# declares a RESEARCH_*.md Artifact does not correlate to the ADR and leaves
# it gapped (references/adr-template.md documents the two-path convergence).
#
# CHALLENGER_PROTOCOL.md already defines the trigger table and report
# format (docs/reviews/CHALLENGE_REPORT_<slug>_<date>.md, a header line
# "**Date:** <date> | **Artifact:** <path> | **Challenger:** ..." followed
# by a "## Summary" block with "- CONTRADICTED: N" and "- Action required:
# YES/NO" lines) -- this validator is the enforcement side: confirmed
# 2026-07-07 that zero validators actually checked for a challenge report's
# existence, so the prose trigger table was opt-in in practice.
#
# Scope (deliberately narrower than CHALLENGER_PROTOCOL.md's full trigger
# table, matching this ticket's rescoped text): docs/reviews/*.md and
# docs/security/*.md, excluding CHALLENGE_REPORT_*.md files themselves.
# CONTRADICTED-count resolution is read from the report's own Summary block
# as written -- this validator does not track whether a CONTRADICTED
# finding was subsequently addressed in the original artifact; a report
# that still shows CONTRADICTED > 0 is unresolved by definition until the
# report itself is revised down to 0 (or a fresh report replaces it).
#
# Slug/date correlation (T22.20): T27.3 shipped a pure existence count --
# "at least one CHALLENGE_REPORT exists anywhere" -- which independent
# review (2026-07-08) showed is bypassable: a stale, unrelated, clean
# challenge report satisfies the gate forever, even for a brand-new
# never-challenged CRITICAL finding in a different report. This validator
# now requires each SOURCE report (the one with the HIGH/CRITICAL finding)
# to be individually matched to a challenge report that declares it via the
# header's "**Artifact:** <path>" field. The Artifact field is already
# mandatory in CHALLENGER_PROTOCOL.md's report template, so no new slug
# convention needed inventing. Matching: if the declared path contains a
# "/" it is compared as a full ROOT-relative path (exact string, after
# stripping a leading "./") -- this avoids a same-basename collision
# between, say, docs/reviews/FINDINGS.md and docs/security/FINDINGS.md,
# which a pure-basename compare would incorrectly conflate (that would be
# the exact bug class this ticket exists to close, just one level down).
# If the declared path is a bare filename (no "/"), it is compared against
# the source's basename -- but ONLY when that basename is unique among all
# of THIS run's source reports. Two source reports sharing a basename in
# different directories (docs/reviews/FINDINGS.md, docs/security/FINDINGS.md)
# make a bare "FINDINGS.md" declaration genuinely ambiguous: it cannot say
# which one was actually challenged, so it satisfies NEITHER (fail closed,
# same "ambiguous -> gate red" posture the rest of this validator already
# takes for a malformed report). Either way the comparison is exact-string,
# no fuzzy matching, so a near-miss filename does not accidentally match. A
# challenge report with no parseable Artifact field cannot satisfy any
# source's requirement (same treatment as a missing CONTRADICTED line --
# see "malformed-challenge-report" below).
#
# Non-goal: this does not fall back to matching by date proximity or by
# a slug parsed out of the CHALLENGE_REPORT_<slug>_<date>.md filename --
# the ticket allowed either approach and the Artifact-field basename match
# was judged more robust (no regex on human-chosen slugs) and simpler to
# reason about. A challenge report MUST declare its Artifact field for its
# clean verdict to count toward any source's requirement.
