#
# validate-phase-gate.sh -- orchestrator that runs all validators relevant to
# the current SDLC phase and aggregates their results.
#
# Usage:
#   validate-phase-gate.sh <phase> [project-root]
#
# Phases:
#   phase-0        -- Ideation (VISION, COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS)
#   phase-1        -- Planning (SCOPE, RISKS, CONSTRAINTS, USER_PERSONAS)
#   phase-2        -- Requirements (SRS, USER_STORIES, USE_CASES)
#   phase-3        -- Design (ARCHITECTURE, API, DATABASE, THREAT_MODEL)
#   phase-4        -- Implementation (per-module RUNTIME reports)
#   phase-5        -- Release (FIX_BACKLOG closed, all reviews READY)
#   onboard-deep   -- Onboard deep mode (INVENTORY + ARCHITECTURE + ERD)
#   security-deep  -- Security deep mode (OWASP all 10 ≥ 7 + attack chains)
#   feature        -- Scoped: changed files on branch all covered by reviews
#   improve        -- Scoped: every audit synthesized into IMPROVEMENT_BACKLOG
#
# Exits 0 if every relevant validator passes, 1 otherwise. Aggregated JSON
# gap list on stdout.
#
# Gate receipts (T27.1): a clean gate writes docs/work/gates/<phase>-receipt.json
# instead of a bare timestamp lock. The receipt records exactly what ran (every
# validator's name, exit code, gap count), the phase's file list, and a content
# hash of those files -- so a later prereq check can tell a real pass from a
# touched/fabricated one, and detect when the underlying docs or the gate's own
# validator set have changed since the receipt was minted. See
# check_phase_prereq() below for the read side.
