#
# validate-scope.sh -- confirm git writes (staged + unstaged + untracked) are
# confined to the assigned write-scope directory.
#
# Used as a post-HANDOFF gate during parallel waves: every coding-agent
# HANDOFF is assigned an exclusive directory (e.g. src/auth/); this script
# proves the agent stayed inside its lane.
#
# Usage:
#   validate-scope.sh <assigned-dir> [assigned-dir2 ...] [--root <project-root>]
#
# The assigned-dir(s) are relative to the project root. Pass multiple to
# allow writes across several directories (e.g. src/auth/ AND tests/auth/).
#
# Files ALWAYS allowed regardless of scope:
#   - docs/work/**       (sdlc-state, context packets, manifests)
#   - docs/reviews/**    (completion manifests, review reports)
#   - .sdlc-state        (legacy)

# -uall is load-bearing on a GREENFIELD ticket.
#
# Plain `--porcelain` collapses a wholly-new untracked directory to a single
# entry -- `?? tests/` -- instead of listing the files inside it. The
# prefix match below then compares the literal string "tests/" against a
# write_scope of "tests/parse.test.js", fails to classify it, and reports
# "tests/ written outside assigned scope" on a ticket that wrote exactly what
# it was assigned. Any ticket creating a directory that does not exist yet is
# unpassable, which is every first ticket in a new project.
#
# This was known and worked around in the wrong place: conductor.test.mjs
# pre-creates its scope directories as TRACKED, with a comment explaining the
# collapse, so the fixture passed while the product stayed broken. Found for
# real 2026-07-31 by scripts/e2e-sdlc-path.mjs on a fresh project.
