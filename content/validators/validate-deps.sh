# validate-deps.sh -- run a CVE / advisory check on dependencies.
#
# Auto-detects per stack:
#   node:   npm audit --audit-level=high --json
#   python: pip-audit -f json
#   rust:   cargo audit --json
#   go:     govulncheck ./...
#
# Override via .sdlc/sdlc.json "deps" key. Optional .sdlc/deps-waivers.txt
# (one CVE-ID or advisory ID per line) suppresses known-accepted advisories.
#
# Writes docs/reviews/RUNTIME_deps_<date>.md with the count of CRITICAL/HIGH
# advisories. Exits non-zero on any unwaived high-severity advisory.
