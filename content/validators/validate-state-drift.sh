# validate-state-drift.sh -- docs/work/STATE.md's "Done" claims must be
# backed by a real gate receipt, not just asserted (T27.4).
#
# STATE.md (CHECKPOINT_STATE.md's schema) is free-text, hand/agent-written:
# "## Done\n- phase-4 done -- ..." is a claim, not proof. This validator
# cross-checks it against docs/work/gates/<phase>-receipt.json (T27.1) --
# the same receipt validate-phase-gate.sh writes on a real run and
# check_phase_prereq() reads. Two call sites:
#   - /sdlc resume (agents/sdlc-lead.md): WARN before trusting "Next" --
#     surfaces divergence instead of resuming into fiction.
#   - run-until-done.sh's is_complete(): BLOCKS -- the promise token alone
#     is a request to evaluate completion, not proof of it; this is what
#     turns it into proof.
#
# Only checks phases STATE.md itself claims are done. A STATE.md that
# claims nothing gated (a Mode 4 audit with no phase gates, or no STATE.md
# at all) has nothing to cross-check -- clean, not a gap. That's the
# intentional discrimination: "legitimately ungated task" vs "agent skipped
# the gates" is exactly what claim-then-verify can tell apart and a blanket
# receipts-required check can't.
#
# "Receipt says real/waiver" inherits T27.1's disclosed tradeoff: not
# cryptographic tamper-evidence, a sloppy/eager-agent deterrent (anyone with
# filesystem access could hand-craft a passing receipt). Not re-litigated
# here -- same threat model as everywhere else this session used the
# receipt primitive.
#
# Usage: validate-state-drift.sh [project-root] [state-path]
# state-path defaults to <project-root>/docs/work/STATE.md (CHECKPOINT_STATE.md's
# canonical location) but can be overridden -- run-until-done.sh's --state flag
# points at an arbitrary path for test isolation, and the drift check has to
# follow it rather than silently checking the (nonexistent) canonical path and
# vacuously passing.
# Exit 0 clean / 1 gaps / 2 error.

# shellcheck disable=SC1091
