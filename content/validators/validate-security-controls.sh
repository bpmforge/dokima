# validate-security-controls.sh -- ensures SECURITY_CONTROLS.md exists and
# that every HIGH/CRITICAL threat in THREAT_MODEL.md has a corresponding
# control entry, and that DATABASE.md, API_DESIGN.md, and ARCHITECTURE.md
# each contain a security section incorporating the controls.
#
# Part of Phase 3 gate -- runs after threat model feedback loop completes.
#
# T29.4 adds three more checks (Bootstrap & Empty-State checklist,
# self-referential/circular permission gate, RBAC cardinality). They run
# right after the SECURITY_CONTROLS.md existence check and BEFORE the
# THREAT_MODEL.md-presence branch -- independent review (2026-07-09) found
# that appending them after the pre-existing "no THREAT_MODEL.md -> warn +
# validator_exit" early return made them silently unreachable whenever a
# project had a bootstrap-authority hole but hadn't written THREAT_MODEL.md
# yet, exactly the gap this ticket exists to catch.
#
# Known limitation: the direct (1-hop) self-reference check's `[^.]*` window
# is sentence-scoped, not clause-scoped -- a 2-hop mutual cycle phrased as one
# run-on sentence ("only A may grant B, and only B may grant A") can trip
# the 1-hop branch first (both role names appear twice in the same
# sentence) instead of the dedicated N-hop cycle branch. This only affects
# which gap MESSAGE is produced (mislabeled as "self-referential" instead of
# "N-hop circular"); the outcome (flagged as a gap unless a real bootstrap
# escape is documented, same `bootstrap_escape_ok` check either way) is
# identical either way, so it is not a false negative.
