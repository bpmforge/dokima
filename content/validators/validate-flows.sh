# validate-flows.sh -- validates docs/design/flows.md, the ROOT of the design
# chain (ux-researcher's output). tokens.json (design-system-lead), components.md,
# UX_SPEC.md, and microcopy.md all derive from it -- so a malformed flows.md
# silently corrupts 3+ downstream agents, yet it was the only design-chain root
# with no validator (its siblings have validate-ux-spec.sh / validate-design-
# tokens.sh). This closes that gap.
#
# Checks (structural, offline):
#   1. flows.md exists in docs/design/ and is non-empty -- UNLESS the project
#      declares itself headless in ARCHITECTURE.md (same escape as validate-ux-spec).
#   2. A user-flow section with at least one Mermaid diagram (the flows).
#   3. A screen-inventory section that names screens (the derivation source
#      design-system-lead/components.md and UX_SPEC build from).
#   4. No placeholder text ([TODO], [TBD], PLACEHOLDER).
#
# Usage: validate-flows.sh [project-root]
# Exit 0 clean/skipped / 1 gaps / 2 error.
