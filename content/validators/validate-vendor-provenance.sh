#
# validate-vendor-provenance.sh -- library-shaped reimplementation gate
# (T29.8, R-30, field lesson B-2).
#
# Field lesson: a design doc claimed "we use library X" for a vendored/
# copy-paste component set. What was actually shipped was AI-written from
# memory -- renamed variants, dropped sizes, an older template -- never
# pulled from the real library. A reviewing developer caught it as
# "reinventing the component lib." No step ever checked "is this actually X,
# or just X-shaped?"
#
# Provenance contract this validator enforces: any directory that vendors
# (copy-pastes, not a runtime dependency) code from an external library MUST
# carry a `VENDORED.md` manifest in that same directory recording where the
# files came from. `VENDORED.md` is a flat `key: value` file (deliberately
# not YAML frontmatter -- this repo's other manifests use that shape, but a
# flat key:value file needs no parser dependency and is trivial to diff):
#
#   source: shadcn/ui
#   tool: npx shadcn@latest add
#   version: 2.3.1
#   files: button.tsx, card.tsx, dialog.tsx
#
# ...or, when a file genuinely could not be pulled from upstream and was
# approximated from memory instead, the divergence must be declared rather
# than presented as an unqualified "we use X":
#
#   source: shadcn/ui
#   generated-from-memory: true
#   divergence: upstream CLI unavailable offline; button.tsx hand-written,
#     may not match the real button.tsx exactly
#
# Two gap classes:
#   1. undeclared-vendor-provenance -- a directory whose README/docs use
#      vendoring language ("vendored from", "copied from", "based on",
#      "adapted from" a named library) but has no VENDORED.md sibling. No
#      one recorded where the code actually came from.
#   2. Per-VENDORED.md gaps (missing-provenance / dropped-variant /
#      undeclared-variant / undeclared-divergence) -- see check_manifest().
#
# Usage: validate-vendor-provenance.sh [project-root] [scan-path]
# Exit: 0 = clean, 1 = gaps found, 2 = validator error

# shellcheck disable=SC1091
