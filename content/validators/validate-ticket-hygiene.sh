# validate-ticket-hygiene.sh -- ticket LIFECYCLE hygiene audit (T26.2).
#
# Root cause this closes: the 2026-07-07 incident where an executor worked
# tickets without claiming, commenting, or closing them and self-asserted
# "done" -- the audit trail was lost. Distinct from validate-tickets.sh
# (structural graph validity: schema shape, DAG, write-scope collisions --
# "is this plan.json shaped correctly"). This checks whether the lifecycle
# was actually FOLLOWED, via scripts/lib/ticket-hygiene.mjs:
#   - a 'done' module missing complete history/evidence/manifest
#   - one owner holding more than one open (claimed/in_progress) ticket
#   - a claim open (claimed/in_progress) for more than 7 days
#   - TICKETS.md/STATE.md's rendered status contradicting plan.json (drift)
#   - an evidence commit touching a file outside the ticket's write_scope,
#     or citing a commit that doesn't exist in this repo's history at all
#     (audit <-> code cross-check)
#
# Usage: validate-ticket-hygiene.sh [project-root] [plan.json] [tickets.md] [state.md]
# Exit 0 clean / 1 gaps / 2 error.
