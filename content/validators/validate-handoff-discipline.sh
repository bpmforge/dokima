# validate-handoff-discipline.sh -- delegation must HANDOFF, never naively spawn.
#
# opencode (and any runtime without a blocking subagent tool) cannot spawn a
# child agent. Delegation there is a HANDOFF block the user pastes into a new
# session. Agents express delegation as `task(agent="X", ...)` SHORTHAND, which
# every such file must declare maps to a HANDOFF, gated by `has_task_tool`
# (Executor A/B) with a no-spawn fallback (Executor C: emit-as-text, wait for
# user). This validator fails any agent that uses task()-shorthand without both
# the HANDOFF translation and the no-spawn fallback -- so the discipline can't
# silently regress into "the model tries to call task() and the runtime can't."
#
# It also flags hard spawn calls (Agent(...) / subagent_type) in agent prose,
# which bypass the HANDOFF contract entirely.
#
# Third check: coordinator files that dispatch specialists CONCURRENTLY ("Dispatch
# Wave", "emit N HANDOFFs simultaneously / in parallel / in one message") express
# the same naive-spawn assumption in the `HANDOFF to:` prose format rather than
# task() shorthand -- so the two checks above miss them. Any such file must gate on
# has_task_tool / EXECUTOR_SELECTION so it degrades to sequential-inline (Executor
# D) or manual paste (C) when the runtime cannot spawn. This is the exact class
# that let security-auditor ship a gate-less parallel dispatch.
#
# Usage: validate-handoff-discipline.sh [project-root]
# Exit 0 clean / 1 gaps / 2 error.
