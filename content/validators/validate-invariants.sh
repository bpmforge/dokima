# validate-invariants.sh -- enforce a project's declared cross-cutting rules.
#
# The failure this closes: a route that bypassed the audited-transaction seam every
# other route in its codebase uses, and PASSED ITS OWN TESTS. Nothing in "does it
# work" surfaces a cross-cutting architectural violation the ticket's spec never
# mentioned. It was caught only because a reviewer happened to know the invariant
# existed and checked by hand.
#
# That knowledge is exactly what an agent given a bounded ticket does not have, and
# what a human who wrote the surrounding code has for free. This makes it explicit
# and mechanical, so it stops depending on who reviews.
#
# Declare invariants in .sdlc/invariants.json:
#
#   { "invariants": [
#       { "name": "routes use the audited transaction seam",
#         "files": "src/api/**/*.ts",
#         "require": "withAuditedTx",
#         "exclude": "src/api/health.ts",
#         "why": "every mutation must land in the audit log (ADR-014)" },
#       { "name": "no local auth helpers",
#         "files": "src/api/**/*.ts",
#         "forbid": "function getAuthUser",
#         "why": "import from utils/auth-helpers, never redefine" }
#   ] }
#
# `require` = the pattern MUST appear in each matched file.
# `forbid`  = the pattern must NOT appear.
# Both are grep -E patterns. `why` is printed on failure -- an invariant whose
# reason is not stated gets deleted by the next person who hits it.
#
# Usage: validate-invariants.sh [project-root]
# Exit:  0 clean / 1 violations / 0 with a notice when nothing is declared.
