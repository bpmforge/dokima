# validate-autonomy-ledger.sh -- APPROVALS.md rows are well-formed and every
# NEVER-AUTO row is human-signed (T27.5).
#
# validate-autonomy-wiring.sh checks prose (every by-design pause references
# the autonomy protocol). This validator checks the OTHER side: the ledger
# that a real auto-mode run actually produces. It verifies:
#   1. every docs/work/APPROVALS.md row is well-formed (timestamp,
#      pause_site_id, default_taken, signed_by all present)
#   2. every pause_site_id is a real id from AUTONOMY_PROTOCOL.md's G-*/NA-*
#      tables, not a typo or an invented one
#   3. NEVER-AUTO tripwire: any row whose id is NA-* must be signed by an
#      actual human (waive-gate.sh's exact blocklist + normalization) --
#      NEVER-AUTO sites always pause, so if one made it into the ledger at
#      all, "auto" or an agent's own name in signed_by means it was
#      auto-defaulted or self-signed instead of genuinely reviewed.
#
# Non-goals (see AUTONOMY_PROTOCOL.md "Ledger verification"): this checks the
# ledger a session wrote about itself. It cannot prove a NEVER-AUTO action
# happened and was never logged at all -- there is no independent run-journal
# in this repo today. That residual gap is M28 (Conductor) scope, not this
# validator's. It also, like waive-gate.sh's blocklist, is a deterrent
# against a sloppy/eager agent self-signing or auto-defaulting a NEVER-AUTO
# row -- not a security boundary against a determined adversary: a
# fabricated human-sounding name in signed_by (anything not on the blocklist)
# passes cleanly, same as waive-gate.sh's own stated non-goal.
#
# Usage: validate-autonomy-ledger.sh [project-root]
# Exit 0 clean / 1 gaps / 2 error.
