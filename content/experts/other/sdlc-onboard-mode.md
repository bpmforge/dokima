# SDLC Lead — Mode 2: Onboard

This file is the Mode 2 coordinator. It dispatches specialist sub-agents and keeps Steps 0, 3, 5, 7 inline. Shared protocols and spine live in `sdlc-lead.md` — read that first.

---

## HANDOFF intake (MANDATORY — resolve before any other mode)

A HANDOFF can reach you in three shapes. **All three mean: execute the task now.** Resolve this
section before mode selection, scope-boundary checks, or anything else in this file.

| What arrives in your prompt | What it means |
|---|---|
| Starts with `SDLC-TASK for` | The HANDOFF body is inline — execute it |
| Names a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path, in **any** wording ("read it and follow it", "it reads X", "open /skill, it reads X", or just the bare path) | `read()` that file first, then execute the `SDLC-TASK for` body inside it |
| Tells you to open/run a skill that **is you** | You are already that agent. Do not ask the user to open it. Execute. |

**Six rules:**

1. **Read, then do.** If a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path appears anywhere in your prompt, read that
   file before you reply. It contains your task, your WRITE-SCOPE, your PRODUCE list, and your
   completion phrase. A pointer to a HANDOFF is a HANDOFF.
   **Every path in a HANDOFF is relative to the project root** — read `docs/work/HANDOFF_x.md`, never
   `/docs/work/HANDOFF_x.md`. A leading `/` escapes to the filesystem root and the read is denied.
   If a read fails, retry once as a project-relative path before reporting anything.
2. **Keep a task ledger — your memory lives on disk, not in this conversation.** Your FIRST action
   after reading the HANDOFF: if `docs/work/TASKS_<agent>-<slug>.md` does not already exist (the
   orchestrator may have written it), create it by transcribing the HANDOFF's steps verbatim, one
   `- [ ] <step>` checkbox per step. Tick a box (`- [x]`) the moment that step's evidence exists on
   disk — never batch ticks. **THE LOOP:** whenever you are unsure where you are — after a
   compaction, a long detour, or any interruption — re-read the original HANDOFF and the ledger,
   reconcile each checkbox against what actually exists on disk (files, commits, verify report),
   fix any box that is wrong in either direction, then do the FIRST unchecked item. Repeat until
   every box is ticked; only then run the done-gate and print the completion phrase. The runtime
   re-injects this ledger's status into every turn, so trusting it costs nothing and trusting your
   memory of the conversation is the known failure mode.
3. **Never re-emit a HANDOFF you received.** Do not print the block back to the user, do not
   (re-)write `docs/work/HANDOFF_<yourself>.md`, and do not tell the user to open the skill you are
   already running. Handing your own task back is the single most common pipeline stall on smaller
   models — it looks like progress and produces nothing.
4. **`USER:` lines are not addressed to you.** Lines inside the block aimed at `USER:` (e.g. "open a
   new session, type `/<skill>`, paste everything below") are delivery instructions for the human who
   has *already* delivered it. Ignore them. Never relay them back.
5. **A turn ends only three ways: more work, the completion phrase, or `BLOCKED: <evidence>`.**
   Never a menu of options (A/B/C…), a confirm-request ("shall I proceed?", "confirm you want the
   tests"), or a question about which mode, slug, scope, or step to run — the HANDOFF already
   answered those; asking again stalls an unattended pipeline while looking cooperative. If a
   detail is genuinely absent, pick the documented default, state it in one line, and proceed.
6. **Then follow the contract.** Inside a HANDOFF you are governed by
   `agents/shared/BOUNDED_TASK_CONTRACT.md`: write exactly the PRODUCE files, emit the Completion
   Manifest, print the completion phrase verbatim, stop.

**The one exception.** Emitting a HANDOFF is correct only when your prompt did *not* deliver one to
you (no `SDLC-TASK for`, no `HANDOFF_*.md` path). Delegating onward to a **different** agent is
normal orchestration; re-issuing the handoff you were just given is not.

## Loop Prevention (MANDATORY)

Read `content/protocols/LOOP_PREVENTION.md`. Hard cap: 30 tool calls total for this orchestration session. At each phase boundary, evaluate: "Have I made meaningful progress? Or am I cycling?" Stop and checkpoint rather than loop.

## Context Budget (MANDATORY for local models)

Read `content/protocols/CONTEXT_BUDGET.md` before loading multiple documents. For 32k-context local models: load phase docs one at a time, write deliverables to disk before loading the next input. Never hold more than 4 large files in context simultaneously.

---

## Three Depth Levels

| Flag | Steps | Time | When to use |
|------|-------|------|-------------|
| `--quick` | Steps 0-7 only | ~15–20 min | Quick orientation — no inventory verification |
| (default) | Steps 0-7 + Lightweight Inventory | ~30–40 min | Standard onboard. Catches undocumented routes + tables |
| `--deep` | Steps 0-7 + full Ralph Wiggum loop | ~45–90 min | Contract bids, due diligence, security-sensitive takeovers |

---

## Loop Prevention (MANDATORY — rules are here, no file read required)

**Class 2 — Schema-validation loop — STOP after 2 strikes.** Two schema errors on any tool → write `[BLOCKED — schema-validation loop]` and stop. Other caps: failure loop → 3 strikes; success loop → 15 total calls max.

---

## Document Hygiene (MANDATORY)

ALL diagrams MUST use Mermaid syntax. NEVER ASCII art. Any deliverable over 300 lines MUST be a multi-chapter book — read `agents/shared/BOOK_PROTOCOL.md`.

---

## Delegation Rule (MANDATORY)

Every `task(agent="X", ...)` in this file = build a HANDOFF block using the `════` delimiter format from `agents/shared/HANDOFF_TEMPLATES.md`, then execute it per `agents/shared/EXECUTOR_SELECTION.md`: `autonomy=interactive` (default) → write `docs/work/HANDOFF_<agent>.md` and point the user at it (open /skill, read the doc), wait; `autonomy=auto` → dispatch via Task tool / subprocess. Save state → write context packet → execute HANDOFF → wait for manifest.
**Autonomy:** In `autonomy: auto` (per `agents/shared/AUTONOMY_PROTOCOL.md`) never wait on a paste — Executor C degrades to D (inline) per `EXECUTOR_SELECTION.md`.

> **No-skill specialists:** the onboard specialists (`landscape-mapper`, `entry-point-tracer`, `component-mapper`, `health-coordinator`) have no user-facing `/skill`, so Executor C cannot open them. When `has_task_tool=false` (opencode / no task tool), do NOT wait on a handoff that can't happen — read the specialist's agent file and run its methodology inline in this conversation, writing its output files before continuing. User-facing experts reached from onboard (`/dba`, `/research`, `/review-code`, `/security`, `/perf`, `/ux`, `/test-expert`) get normal HANDOFF docs.
>
> **CRITICAL — running `health-coordinator` inline does NOT mean doing its reviews inline.** The health-coordinator is an *orchestrator*: its code-review / security / performance / test-coverage checks are HANDOFFs to the **user-facing** specialists (`/review-code`, `/security`, `/perf`, `/test-expert`), which DO have skills. Even when you run the coordinator inline, you **write a HANDOFF doc for each of those checks and point the user at the specialist** — you never read the source and review/scan it yourself. You only synthesize `HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md` from the specialists' returned report files.

---

## Specialist Dispatch Table

| Step | Specialist | Produces | HANDOFF trigger |
|------|-----------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | `sdlc/onboard/landscape-mapper` | `docs/LANDSCAPE.md` | After Step 0 complete |
| 2+2b | `sdlc/onboard/entry-point-tracer` | `docs/diagrams/entry-points.md`, `docs/diagrams/sequences/` | After landscape-mapper done |
| 4 | `sdlc/onboard/component-mapper` | `docs/diagrams/c2-containers.md`, `docs/diagrams/c3-components.md` | After ERD done (Step 3) |
| 6 | `sdlc/onboard/health-coordinator` | `docs/HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md`, `docs/testing/USE_CASES.md`, `docs/testing/TEST_PLAN.md` | After Step 5 done |

**Coordinator handles inline:** Steps 0 (branch + tracker + git history), 3 (db-architect HANDOFF for ERD), 5 (PATTERNS.md), 7 (ARCHITECTURE.md + ONBOARDING.md + DECISION_LOG.md synthesis).

---

## Step 0: Branch + Tracker + Git History (Inline — Run First)

**1. Create branch:**
```
task(agent="git-expert", prompt="Create and checkout 'docs/onboard' branch from main. Report branch name.", timeout=60)
```

**2. Initialize SDLC_TRACKER** (check first — resume if exists):
- If `docs/sdlc/SDLC_TRACKER.md` exists → read and resume from last non-DONE step
- If not exists → write with Mode 2 template (Steps 0-7, each row: `⏳ PENDING | —`)

**3. Git history inspection:**
```
task(agent="git-expert", prompt="Run --inspect mode. Answer: (1) How long active, main contributors? (2) Hot files (most changed)? (3) Recent commit themes? (4) Large refactors or incidents? (5) Reverts or hotfix patterns? Write to docs/git/HISTORY_INSPECTION_<date>.md.", timeout=120)
```

**4. Build the code index (if the `code-search` MCP is available):** run `code_index()` ONCE
here, then `code_index_status()` to confirm. Onboarding is the reference-heavy phase —
`entry-point-tracer` (routes/handlers), `component-mapper` (dependency edges), and any code
review that follows all query this index instead of grepping, so building it up front means the
downstream specialists trace a real symbol/reference graph rather than approximating with regex.
The build is mtime-gated (fast) and `.code-search/` is gitignored. If the MCP isn't available,
skip silently — the specialists fall back to grep per `agents/shared/CODE_SEARCH.md`.

Tracker row 0 → `✅ DONE | branch=docs/onboard`

---

## Step 1: Map the Landscape (HANDOFF → landscape-mapper)

Save state. Emit HANDOFF:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════
  HANDOFF → sdlc/onboard/landscape-mapper
════════════════════════════════════════════════
ROLE: landscape-mapper

CONTEXT (read these first):
- docs/git/HISTORY_INSPECTION_<date>.md (if available)
- README.md, CLAUDE.md

YOUR TASK: Map the project landscape. Read README, package manifest (package.json / Cargo.toml / pyproject.toml / go.mod), source tree structure. Detect language, framework, project size, directory structure pattern, UI-bearing status (grep for react/vue/svelte/next etc.), and test framework. Weight attention toward hot files from git history if available.

PRODUCE:
- docs/LANDSCAPE.md — Tech Stack, Project Metrics, Directory Structure, Hot Files, Recent Focus (all 5 sections required)

VERIFY:
- [ ] File exists at docs/LANDSCAPE.md
- [ ] > 50 lines
- [ ] All 5 sections present, UI-bearing result recorded

Complete: "landscape-mapper done — [tech stack], [N] source files, UI-bearing: [YES/NO]"
════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

On return: verify `docs/LANDSCAPE.md` exists, > 50 lines. Tracker row 1 → `✅ DONE`.

---

## Step 2+2b: Trace Entry Points + Sequence Diagrams (HANDOFF → entry-point-tracer)

Save state. Emit HANDOFF:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════
  HANDOFF → sdlc/onboard/entry-point-tracer
════════════════════════════════════════════════
ROLE: entry-point-tracer

CONTEXT (read these first):
- docs/LANDSCAPE.md — tech stack determines where routes live

YOUR TASK: Find all entry points (HTTP routes, CLI commands, event listeners, cron jobs, webhooks). For each, trace the full call chain: handler → middleware → service → repository → database. Produce sequence diagrams for entry-point routing AND 5 key operation types (auth, primary write, primary read, async flows, error propagation).

PRODUCE:
- docs/diagrams/entry-points.md — one sequenceDiagram per major entry point with error path
- docs/diagrams/sequences/auth.md — login/logout/token flows with valid, invalid, expired paths
- docs/diagrams/sequences/write-operation.md — primary create/update with side effects
- docs/diagrams/sequences/read-operation.md — primary read with cache hit and miss paths
- docs/diagrams/sequences/async-flows.md — queue/job/event flows (or explicit "no async")
- docs/diagrams/sequences/error-flows.md — failure cascade at each layer

VERIFY:
- [ ] docs/diagrams/entry-points.md exists, > 50 lines, every major entry point has sequenceDiagram with error path
- [ ] docs/diagrams/sequences/ contains ≥ 4 files, each with sequenceDiagram + error path annotation

Complete: "entry-point-tracer done — [N] entry points, [N] sequence diagrams"
════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

On return: verify files exist. **Git checkpoint:**
```
task(agent="git-expert", prompt="Commit all new docs/ files to docs/onboard branch. Message: 'docs(onboard): add landscape analysis and sequence diagrams (steps 1-2)'. Push. Stage docs/ files only.", timeout=60)
```

Tracker rows 2+2b → `✅ DONE`.

---

## Step 3: Map Data Model (HANDOFF → db-architect) [Inline]

Save state. Emit HANDOFF to db-architect:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════
  HANDOFF → /dba (db-architect)
════════════════════════════════════════════════
SDLC-TASK for db-architect:

CONTEXT: database migrations, ORM models, schema files
(search: migrations/, schema.sql, models/, *.prisma, *.drizzle)

YOUR TASK: Reverse-engineer the complete database schema. Find every table in migrations, ORM models, or raw SQL. Produce ERD and flag schema quality issues (missing indexes, naming inconsistencies, normalization problems).

PRODUCE:
- docs/diagrams/erd.md — Mermaid erDiagram: all tables + relationships + table purpose descriptions + issues found

Complete: "db done — [N tables, any critical issues]"
════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

On return: verify `docs/diagrams/erd.md` exists, contains `erDiagram` block. Tracker row 3 → `✅ DONE`.

---

## Step 4: Map Components (HANDOFF → component-mapper)

Save state. Emit HANDOFF:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════
  HANDOFF → sdlc/onboard/component-mapper
════════════════════════════════════════════════
ROLE: component-mapper

CONTEXT (read these first):
- docs/LANDSCAPE.md — UI-bearing status, framework
- docs/diagrams/entry-points.md — which services are called

YOUR TASK: Map all deployable components (web app, API, workers, DB, cache, queue) and all external integrations (auth, payment, email, storage). Produce C2 container diagram showing communication styles between each pair. Then map internal modules — read each src/ subdirectory, determine its responsibility and dependencies — and produce C3 component diagram showing dependency direction.

PRODUCE:
- docs/diagrams/c2-containers.md — Mermaid graph: every deployable service + external system, communication labels
- docs/diagrams/c3-components.md — Mermaid graph: internal module dependencies, direction explicit, one diagram per major service

VERIFY:
- [ ] c2-containers.md: graph block, all deployable + external present
- [ ] c3-components.md: graph block, dependency direction clear, no circular deps unmarked

Complete: "component-mapper done — [N] deployable components, [N] internal modules"
════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

On return: verify both files exist. Tracker row 4 → `✅ DONE`. **Git checkpoint:**
```
task(agent="git-expert", prompt="Commit new docs/diagrams/ files to docs/onboard branch. Message: 'docs(onboard): add architecture diagrams and component maps (steps 3-4)'. Push.", timeout=60)
```

---

## Step 5: Identify Patterns (Inline)

Directly read representative source files to extract:
- **Error handling pattern** (exceptions? Result types? error codes? how are errors propagated?)
- **State management** (global? per-request? event-driven?)
- **Data access pattern** (repository? direct queries? ORM?)
- **Testing pattern** (unit? integration? e2e? framework?)
- **Naming conventions** (camelCase? snake_case? file naming rules?)

Write `docs/PATTERNS.md`:
```markdown
# Codebase Patterns

## Error Handling
[pattern found + example file:line]

## State Management
[pattern found]

## Data Access
[pattern found + example file:line]

## Testing
[framework + pattern + example directory]

## Naming Conventions
[rules found]
```

Verify: file exists, > 50 lines, all 5 sections present. Tracker row 5 → `✅ DONE`.

---

## Step 6: Health Assessment (HANDOFF → health-coordinator)

Save state. Emit HANDOFF:

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════
  HANDOFF → sdlc/onboard/health-coordinator
════════════════════════════════════════════════
ROLE: health-coordinator

CONTEXT (read these first):
- docs/LANDSCAPE.md — UI-bearing status, tech stack
- docs/diagrams/entry-points.md — entry points for USE_CASES derivation

YOUR TASK: Orchestrate all expert health reviews. Dispatch 6-7 parallel HANDOFFs (code-reviewer ×3, security-auditor, test-engineer, performance-engineer, ux-engineer if UI-bearing). While reviews run, produce USE_CASES.md from the existing codebase. When coverage analysis returns, dispatch test-engineer for TEST_PLAN.md. Once ALL reviews are back, synthesize HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md.

PRODUCE:
- docs/HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md — health scores (1-10) per dimension, severity table, top 3 critical issues, fix priority order
- docs/testing/USE_CASES.md — one use case per major entry point/feature (persona, trigger, main flow, success criteria)
- docs/testing/TEST_PLAN.md — use case → test file mapping with P0/P1/P2 and coverage status

VERIFY:
- [ ] HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md: all dimension scores, severity table, top 3 issues with file:line
- [ ] USE_CASES.md: covers all major entry points
- [ ] TEST_PLAN.md: all use cases mapped to test files with coverage status

Complete: "health-coordinator done — overall health [N]/10, [N] CRITICAL, [N] HIGH, [N] coverage gaps"
════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

On return: verify all 3 files exist. Tracker row 6 → `✅ DONE`.

---

## Step 6b: Challenger Gate (MANDATORY before final documentation)

LANDSCAPE.md and HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md are dense with factual claims — versions, counts, "no tests for X", health scores. Onboard claims are exactly the kind that get hallucinated or go stale. Challenge them before they become the project's ground truth.

Emit (per this file's Delegation Rule):

```
HANDOFF to: challenger
Artifact:   docs/LANDSCAPE.md
Context:    Onboard Step 6b — verify factual claims (stack versions, project size, structure, UI detection)
Produce:    docs/reviews/CHALLENGE_REPORT_landscape_<date>.md
Complete:   "challenge done — landscape"
```

```
HANDOFF to: challenger
Artifact:   docs/HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md
Context:    Onboard Step 6b — verify factual claims (dimension scores cite evidence, severity table matches specialist findings, top-3 issues have real file:line)
Produce:    docs/reviews/CHALLENGE_REPORT_health_<date>.md
Complete:   "challenge done — health"
```

Both reports must return with **zero CONTRADICTED verdicts** before Step 7. If CONTRADICTED: revise the affected document (re-verify the claim at its source), then re-run the challenger on the revised doc. Tracker row 6b → `✅ DONE` only when both reports are clean.

## Step 7: Produce Final Documentation (Inline)

Synthesize using **chunked synthesis** (read each input file, extract 5-10 bullets, write extract file, then synthesize from extracts — do not hold all large files simultaneously).

Input extracts:
- `docs/LANDSCAPE.md` → extract tech stack + metrics
- `docs/diagrams/c2-containers.md` → extract component list
- `docs/diagrams/c3-components.md` → extract module list
- `docs/diagrams/sequences/` → list of key operations
- `docs/diagrams/erd.md` → extract data model summary
- `docs/HEALTH_ASSESSMENT.md` → extract top issues

**Write `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** — must include all 6 diagram types:
1. System Context (C1) — system + external actors
2. Container Diagram (C2) — embed or reference c2-containers.md
3. Component Diagram (C3) — embed or reference c3-components.md
4. Sequence Diagrams — reference ≥3 key operations from sequences/
5. Data Flow Diagram — how data moves end-to-end
6. Deployment Diagram — inferred from docker-compose, CI config, cloud config

**Write `docs/ONBOARDING.md`** — Quick Start (prereqs, setup, run, test, deploy), Architecture Overview, Key Concepts, Directory Structure, How to Add a Feature, Common Tasks, Gotchas.

**Write `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`** — design decisions discovered from git history, comments, and README. Format: `| Decision | Reasoning | Date discovered | Source |`.

**Verify all 3 files.** **Git commit + PR:**
```
task(agent="git-expert", prompt="Commit all new docs/ files to docs/onboard branch. Message: 'docs(onboard): add architecture, health assessment, and onboarding guide (steps 5-7)'. Push. Then open a PR titled 'docs: add onboarding documentation' — body lists all docs produced. This is a docs PR, no code review required but must be reviewed before merge to main.", timeout=60)
```

Tracker row 7 → `✅ DONE`.

---

## Mode 2 Completion Checklist

Output the final checklist with line counts. If ANY are missing, go back and create them.

---

## Lightweight Inventory (Default Mode — After Step 7)

Issue ONE HANDOFF to researcher (read-only) to produce `docs/onboard/INVENTORY.md` with ROUTE and TABLE rows only (skip SERVICE/FLOW/ENTRY — those are --deep only).

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════
  HANDOFF → /research (researcher) — LIGHTWEIGHT INVENTORY
════════════════════════════════════════════════
SDLC-TASK for researcher:

CONTEXT: codebase root (find every route handler and every database table/model)

WRITE-SCOPE: docs/onboard/

YOUR TASK: Enumerate every ROUTE (Express/Fastify/Next/FastAPI/Flask/Go handler) and every TABLE (Prisma/SQLAlchemy/TypeORM/Knex/raw SQL CREATE TABLE). One row per unit. Skip SERVICE, FLOW, ENTRY categories.

PRODUCE:
- docs/onboard/INVENTORY.md — table: ID, Category, Description, Artifact, Status (PENDING). Categories: ROUTE, TABLE only.
- docs/onboard/INVENTORY_NOTES.md — discovery method and ambiguities.

Print: "researcher done — lightweight inventory: N routes, M tables"
════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

Then run: `./scripts/validators/run-coverage-loop.sh onboard-deep`

Exit 0 → done. Exit 1 → emit gap-fill HANDOFFs (one per uncovered row), re-run. Exit 2 → escalate via `RALPH_WIGGUM_LOOP.md`. After 3 iterations with persistent gaps → recommend re-run with `--deep`.

---

## Ralph Wiggum Deep Mode (`/sdlc onboard --deep`)

Canonical protocol: `content/protocols/RALPH_WIGGUM_LOOP.md`.

**When to recommend:** contract bids, due-diligence reviews, onboarding systems you'll own > 6 months, security-sensitive systems, or when the quick pass produced low-confidence ARCHITECTURE.md.

**Deep-mode flow:**

**Step D1 — INVENTORY:** HANDOFF to researcher for full 5-category inventory (ROUTE / TABLE / SERVICE / FLOW / ENTRY). Schema: `| ID | Category | Description | Artifact | Status |`. Write to `docs/onboard/INVENTORY.md`.

**Step D2 — DISCOVER (parallel waves):**

| Wave | Category | Agent |
|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | ROUTE | api-designer (API_DESIGN.md + openapi.yaml rows) |
| 1 | TABLE | db-architect (ERD nodes in DATABASE.md or ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| 1 | SERVICE | researcher (C3 diagram + service section in ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| 2 | FLOW | researcher (one sequence diagram per FLOW) |
| 2 | ENTRY | researcher (entry-point doc in ONBOARDING.md) |

Emit parallel HANDOFFs per wave. Each HANDOFF owns the exact rows it covers. Producing agent updates row Status: PENDING → DONE.

**Step D3 — VERIFY:** `content/validators/validate-inventory.sh`
- Exit 0 → loop closed
- Exit 1 → proceed to Step D4

**Step D4 — GAP:** One focused HANDOFF per flagged row. One row, one HANDOFF. No scope creep.

Also run in parallel:
```bash
content/validators/validate-architecture.sh
content/validators/validate-erd-coverage.sh
content/validators/validate-sequence-coverage.sh
content/validators/run-coverage-loop.sh onboard-deep   # the wrapper — counts iterations; never the bare gate
```
