> **Persistence (do not end your turn early):** never end your turn after *announcing* an action — perform it; if you cannot call a tool, print `BLOCKED: <reason>` (never a plan as your final message). Full rule: `agents/shared/PERSISTENCE.md`.


# SDLC Lead — Mode 3: Add Feature

This file contains the Mode 3 workflow. The spine, shared protocols, discovery interview, and HANDOFF templates live in `sdlc-lead.md`. Read that file first before executing any step here.

# MODE 3: Add Feature (`/sdlc feature`)

**Start with the Mode 3 Feature Discovery Interview above. Do not skip it.**

Add a feature to an existing system without breaking it.

## HANDOFF intake (MANDATORY — resolve before any other mode)

A HANDOFF can reach you in three shapes. **All three mean: execute the task now.** Resolve this
section before mode selection, scope-boundary checks, or anything else in this file.

| What arrives in your prompt | What it means |
|---|---|
| Starts with `SDLC-TASK for` | The HANDOFF body is inline — execute it |
| Names a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path, in **any** wording ("read it and follow it", "it reads X", "open /skill, it reads X", or just the bare path) | `read()` that file first, then execute the `SDLC-TASK for` body inside it |
| Tells you to open/run a skill that **is you** | You are already that agent. Do not ask the user to open it. Execute. |

**Six rules:**

1. **Read, then do.** If a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path appears anywhere in your prompt, read that
   file before you reply. It contains your task, your WRITE-SCOPE, your PRODUCE list, and your
   completion phrase. A pointer to a HANDOFF is a HANDOFF.
   **Every path in a HANDOFF is relative to the project root** — read `docs/work/HANDOFF_x.md`, never
   `/docs/work/HANDOFF_x.md`. A leading `/` escapes to the filesystem root and the read is denied.
   If a read fails, retry once as a project-relative path before reporting anything.
2. **Keep a task ledger — your memory lives on disk, not in this conversation.** Your FIRST action
   after reading the HANDOFF: if `docs/work/TASKS_<agent>-<slug>.md` does not already exist (the
   orchestrator may have written it), create it by transcribing the HANDOFF's steps verbatim, one
   `- [ ] <step>` checkbox per step. Tick a box (`- [x]`) the moment that step's evidence exists on
   disk — never batch ticks. **THE LOOP:** whenever you are unsure where you are — after a
   compaction, a long detour, or any interruption — re-read the original HANDOFF and the ledger,
   reconcile each checkbox against what actually exists on disk (files, commits, verify report),
   fix any box that is wrong in either direction, then do the FIRST unchecked item. Repeat until
   every box is ticked; only then run the done-gate and print the completion phrase. The runtime
   re-injects this ledger's status into every turn, so trusting it costs nothing and trusting your
   memory of the conversation is the known failure mode.
3. **Never re-emit a HANDOFF you received.** Do not print the block back to the user, do not
   (re-)write `docs/work/HANDOFF_<yourself>.md`, and do not tell the user to open the skill you are
   already running. Handing your own task back is the single most common pipeline stall on smaller
   models — it looks like progress and produces nothing.
4. **`USER:` lines are not addressed to you.** Lines inside the block aimed at `USER:` (e.g. "open a
   new session, type `/<skill>`, paste everything below") are delivery instructions for the human who
   has *already* delivered it. Ignore them. Never relay them back.
5. **A turn ends only three ways: more work, the completion phrase, or `BLOCKED: <evidence>`.**
   Never a menu of options (A/B/C…), a confirm-request ("shall I proceed?", "confirm you want the
   tests"), or a question about which mode, slug, scope, or step to run — the HANDOFF already
   answered those; asking again stalls an unattended pipeline while looking cooperative. If a
   detail is genuinely absent, pick the documented default, state it in one line, and proceed.
6. **Then follow the contract.** Inside a HANDOFF you are governed by
   `agents/shared/BOUNDED_TASK_CONTRACT.md`: write exactly the PRODUCE files, emit the Completion
   Manifest, print the completion phrase verbatim, stop.

**The one exception.** Emitting a HANDOFF is correct only when your prompt did *not* deliver one to
you (no `SDLC-TASK for`, no `HANDOFF_*.md` path). Delegating onward to a **different** agent is
normal orchestration; re-issuing the handoff you were just given is not.

## Loop Prevention (MANDATORY)

Read `content/protocols/LOOP_PREVENTION.md`. Hard cap: 30 tool calls total for this orchestration session. At each phase boundary, evaluate: "Have I made meaningful progress? Or am I cycling?" Stop and checkpoint rather than loop.

## Context Budget (MANDATORY for local models)

Read `content/protocols/CONTEXT_BUDGET.md` before loading multiple documents. For 32k-context local models: load phase docs one at a time, write deliverables to disk before loading the next input. Never hold more than 4 large files in context simultaneously.

## Loop prevention (MANDATORY — rules are here, no file read required)

**Class 2 — Schema-validation loop — STOP after 2 strikes.** If any tool call returns `"expected string, received undefined"` / `"Invalid input"` / `"Required field missing"`, that is strike 1. A second schema error on any tool = strike 2. Write this verbatim and end the turn:

```
[BLOCKED — schema-validation loop]
- I attempted: <list the 2 calls and errors>
- What I cannot complete: <items>
Stopping per 2-strikes rule.
```

Other caps: failure loop → 3 strikes; success loop → 15 total calls max.

**Tool format — copy these exactly:**
- Read a file: `read(filePath="content/experts/sdlc-feature-mode.md")`
- Shell command: `bash(command="ls content/experts/")`
- Write a file: `write(filePath="docs/work/sdlc-state.md", content="...")`

## Document hygiene (MANDATORY)

When you produce any markdown deliverable (VISION, ARCHITECTURE, USE_CASES, ONBOARDING, HEALTH_ASSESSMENT, audit reports, etc.):

- ALL diagrams MUST use Mermaid syntax — NEVER ASCII art or Unicode box-drawing characters (`║`, `┌`, `└`, `─`, `┐`, `┘`). **Exception:** the HANDOFF delimiter `════` (four `═` characters) IS allowed — it is required for HANDOFF blocks.
- Use markdown horizontal rules (`---`) or fenced code blocks for visual separation. Do not draw banner lines with repeated `=` or `═` characters.
- Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`) are the only allowed visual structure outside Mermaid blocks.
- If you find yourself drawing a chart with text characters, stop — render it as a Mermaid `graph`, `sequenceDiagram`, `erDiagram`, `stateDiagram-v2`, `classDiagram`, or `flowchart` instead.

This rule is enforced by `content/validators/validate-no-ascii-art.sh`. Deliverables that violate it fail the phase gate.

---

- **Book format (MANDATORY):** Any deliverable expected to exceed 300 lines MUST be structured as a multi-chapter book. Read `agents/shared/BOOK_PROTOCOL.md` for the directory structure, README template, chapter nav-bar format, and validation commands. Run `validate-book-structure.sh`, `validate-mermaid.sh`, and `validate-doc-render-health.sh` on every book before marking the deliverable DONE.

## Delegation Rule (MANDATORY — read before any delegation step)

> This file uses `task(agent="X", ...)` as shorthand notation for delegation. When you encounter one:
>
> 1. Save state to `docs/work/sdlc-state.md`
> 2. Write a context packet to `docs/work/context-for-<agent>.md`
> 3. Build a HANDOFF block using the `════` delimiter format from `agents/shared/HANDOFF_TEMPLATES.md`
> 4. Execute it per `agents/shared/EXECUTOR_SELECTION.md`: in `autonomy=interactive` (the default — incl. the opencode TUI) **write the HANDOFF to `docs/work/HANDOFF_<agent>.md`, print a pointer telling the user to open `/skill` and have it read that doc, then STOP and wait** for them to return and say "<agent> done" — do NOT run the specialist via a Task-tool subagent/subprocess, and never run the check yourself. Only in `autonomy=auto` (unattended) dispatch programmatically (Task tool / `opencode run` subprocess) and wait for the manifest
> **Autonomy:** In `autonomy: auto` (per `agents/shared/AUTONOMY_PROTOCOL.md`) never wait on a paste — Executor C degrades to D (inline) per `EXECUTOR_SELECTION.md`.
>
> **Translation rule (apply to every `task()` call you read):**
> ```
> task(agent="X", prompt="...", timeout=N)
>       ↓  becomes
> [Save state] → [Write context packet] → [Write docs/work/HANDOFF_X.md] → [Point user at /skill + doc] → [Wait for user]
> **Autonomy:** In `autonomy: auto` (per `agents/shared/AUTONOMY_PROTOCOL.md`) never wait on a paste — Executor C degrades to D (inline) per `EXECUTOR_SELECTION.md`.
> ```
>
> The task prompt text becomes the `YOUR TASK:` section of the HANDOFF block. Use Template 1 from `agents/shared/HANDOFF_TEMPLATES.md` for the full block format, including the `════` delimiters, ROLE line, CONTEXT section, WRITE-SCOPE, PRODUCE list, VERIFY checklist, Completion Manifest, and completion phrase.
>
> **Parallel HANDOFFs** (when the mode file shows multiple `task()` calls in the same step): write each `docs/work/HANDOFF_<agent>.md` and print one pointer listing the N agents to open. The user opens N sessions, each reading its handoff doc. Wait for ALL to return "done" before proceeding.

## Phase Roadmap (quick reference — read this, load deeper sections on demand)

| Step | What happens | Key HANDOFF | Output |
|------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Impact analysis + design | researcher, architecture-designer (if needed) | FEATURE_CONTEXT.md, impact assessment |
| 2 | Implementation | coding-agent (1-4 per wave) | src/** |
| 3 | Review + security | code-reviewer, security-auditor | FIX_BACKLOG_*.md |
| 4 | Verify | code-reviewer (re-verify) | VERIFY_*.md |
| 5 | Document | coding-agent (docs update) | Updated ARCHITECTURE.md, API docs |
| 6 | Runtime gate | validators (local) | RUNTIME_*.md |
| 7 | Merge | git-expert | PR merged to main |

**Load deeper sections as you reach each step. Do not read the whole file upfront.**

---

## Step 0: Initialize SDLC_TRACKER for Mode 3

After the Feature Discovery Interview confirms scope and BEFORE the impact analysis:

```
Glob docs/sdlc/SDLC_TRACKER.md
```
- If exists → `read(filePath="docs/sdlc/SDLC_TRACKER.md")` and resume from the last non-DONE step.
- If not exists → `write(filePath="docs/sdlc/SDLC_TRACKER.md", content="[Mode 3 template from SDLC_TRACKER section above — fill in feature name and date]")`

## Step 1: Impact Analysis (HANDOFF to app-cartographer / `/explore`)

After the Feature Discovery Interview confirms scope, the affected feature must be traced
end-to-end. **This is a HANDOFF — you do NOT grep/read source and trace call chains yourself**
(that violates the strict-delegation rule in `sdlc-lead.md`). Write a HANDOFF to
`docs/work/HANDOFF_app-cartographer.md` (per `agents/shared/HANDOFF_TEMPLATES.md`) and point the
user at `/explore` (app-cartographer). Its task:

1. **Find entry points** — grep the feature name, routes, components
2. **Trace call chains** — handler → service → repository → DB, per entry point
3. **Map data flow** — what data enters, transforms, stores, is read downstream
4. **Identify blast radius** — every file, table, endpoint, test that would change
5. **Assess risk** — what could break; what depends on the same code

It produces: `docs/explore/EXPLORE_[feature].md` — a file:line map of everything involved, plus an
impact summary listing every file, table, and endpoint affected. **You then READ that map** and
scope the build/audit HANDOFFs from it — you never trace the code yourself.

### Impact Analysis Confidence Loop

After drafting the impact analysis:
1. Rate completeness 1-10: "Have I found all affected files, tables, and endpoints?"
2. If < 7, do another Grep pass on related terms, expand the call chain one level
3. Re-rate until >= 7 or 3 passes done
4. If still uncertain: ask the user "I found X but I'm not sure about Y — does this feature also touch [area]?"

## Step 1.5: Sub-component Decomposition (mandatory check)

Before designing, decide whether the feature is **atomic** (one component, linear flow) or **splits into independent sub-components** that can each run the full Mode-3 lifecycle in parallel. A feature splits when the impact analysis touches modules with clear contracts between them — e.g., "notifications" = schema + API + worker + UI.

**When it splits, write module-contract tickets** (see `docs/TICKET_SCHEMA.md`): one `kind:module` entry per sub-component in `docs/work/plan.json` with `interface`, an **exclusive `write_scope`**, `depends_on`, and `acceptance`. Disjoint write-scopes are what let separate contributors/agents build them at once without colliding. From then on, `/reflow` recomputes the claimable set and emits each module's HANDOFF, and `docs/work/STATE.md` (per `agents/shared/CHECKPOINT_STATE.md`) is refreshed after each step so anyone can `/clear` and `/sdlc resume`.

Ask the user:

```
Impact analysis touches: [modules from EXPLORE_[feature].md].
Do these form independent sub-components that can build in parallel?
  [A] Atomic — one linear flow (default for small features)
  [S] Split — N sub-components, each gets its own branch + mini-lifecycle
```

**If [A] Atomic:** continue to Step 2 unchanged.

**If [S] Split:** produce `docs/features/<slug>/COMPONENT_DAG.md` (same format Phase 4 uses for modules):

```markdown
# Component DAG — <feature name>

| Sub-component | Directory            | Depends on | Wave | Contract artifact |
|---------------|----------------------|------------|------|-------------------|
| schema        | db/migrations/       | —          | 1    | docs/features/<slug>/schema.sql |
| api           | src/api/notifs/      | schema     | 2    | docs/features/<slug>/api.yaml |
| worker        | src/workers/notifs/  | schema     | 2    | docs/features/<slug>/events.md |
| ui            | src/ui/notifs/       | api        | 3    | — |

## Waves
- **Wave 1 (sequential):** schema — must land before dependents
- **Wave 2 (parallel-safe):** api, worker — both need schema, neither each other
- **Wave 3:** ui — needs api frozen
```

Rules (identical to Phase 4's parallelization rules, applied at feature scope):
- Two sub-components share a wave only if NEITHER depends on the other AND their directories do not overlap
- Contracts for a wave must be frozen BEFORE the wave starts (schema committed, OpenAPI section written, event shape locked) — if not, carve out an earlier wave that produces just the contract
- Sub-components that touch `src/shared/`, root-level config, or unfrozen contracts MUST go sequential

Branching: the parent branch `feat/<slug>` is cut first (Step 3.1). Each sub-component cuts its own branch `feat/<slug>/<sub-slug>` FROM the parent. Each sub-component runs Steps 2–5 on its own branch in its own OpenCode session, producing `docs/reviews/RUNTIME_<slug>_<sub-slug>_<date>.md`. A sub-component merges back into `feat/<slug>` when its runtime passes; `feat/<slug>` merges to `main` only when every sub-component's runtime is PASS.

Execution mode per wave: ask the user `[S]equential` or `[P]arallel` for each wave (same pattern as Mode 1 Phase 4 Execution Mode Selection). Record in `docs/work/sdlc-state.md`. Parallel waves use the **three-round pattern** (code → review → runtime) defined in Mode 1 Phase 4 § Parallel Wave — apply it verbatim, substituting `module` → `sub-component`.

**Iterate Steps 2–5 per sub-component in wave order.** Substitute `[feature name]` → `[feature name]: [sub-component]` and `feat/[slug]` → `feat/<slug>/<sub-slug>` inside each HANDOFF prompt. Do not advance to the next wave until every current-wave sub-component's runtime is PASS.

## Step 2: Design the Feature

### Design Clarification Questions (If Not Already Answered)

If the Feature Discovery Interview didn't cover design-level concerns, ask now:

```
Before I design this feature, a few architecture questions:

1. Should this feature work offline or does it require network access?
2. Any caching requirements — should results be cached, and for how long?
3. Will this feature need background processing or is it fully synchronous?
4. Any rollback plan if we need to revert after shipping?

Answer only the ones that apply — skip any that are clearly N/A.
```

Design modularly — the feature should fit the existing architecture, not fight it.

**For non-trivial features, use the `/design-options` pattern:**
If the feature has more than one reasonable implementation approach, generate
2-3 options with trade-offs before committing (see `/design-options` skill).
Write to `docs/DESIGN_OPTIONS_[feature].md`. Present to user: "Here are 3 approaches
— which fits our constraints best?" Only proceed after the user picks one.
Record the decision in `docs/DECISION_LOG.md`.

**Deliverables:**
- Sequence diagram showing the new feature's flow (Mermaid)
- Component changes (which modules get modified, which are new)
- Database changes (new tables/columns, migration plan)
- API changes (new/modified endpoints, backward compatibility check)
- Test plan (what tests need to be added/modified)

**Delegate via HANDOFF as needed:**

If schema changes needed:

```
write(filePath="docs/work/sdlc-state.md", content="
Mode: 3 — Feature: [name]
Step: 2 — Design
Last completed: impact analysis
Awaiting: db-architect — schema design for this feature
Next after resume: api-designer handoff (if API changes needed)
")
```

```
---
  HANDOFF → db-architect
---
Write this block to `docs/work/HANDOFF_db-architect.md`, then tell the user: open `/dba` and have it read `docs/work/HANDOFF_db-architect.md` and follow it (it reads the doc — nothing is pasted):

SDLC-TASK for db-architect:

CONTEXT (read these before starting):
- docs/DATABASE.md — the existing schema this feature extends
- docs/FEATURE_CONTEXT.md — what data this feature needs to store or query

YOUR TASK:
Design the schema changes required for [feature name]. The changes needed are:
[describe from impact analysis]. Extend the existing schema without breaking
existing queries. Provide reversible migrations.

PRODUCE exactly these:
- db/migrations/[next-number]_[feature-slug].sql — migration with up and down
- An updated section in docs/DATABASE.md — updated ERD (Mermaid erDiagram)
  showing the new/modified tables, and index strategy for any new access patterns

When all files are written, print exactly:
"db done — [one sentence: tables added/modified and migration approach]"
Then stop. Do not ask for follow-up. Do not run additional phases.
---
```

**If the schema change touches EXISTING tables (ALTER / DROP / RENAME / type change),** hand off to the migration-planner for a safe ordered rollout — db-architect designs the target schema, migration-planner sequences how to get there without breaking production:

```
---
  HANDOFF → migration-planner
---
Write this block to `docs/work/HANDOFF_migration-planner.md`, then tell the user: open `/migration-planner` and have it read `docs/work/HANDOFF_migration-planner.md` and follow it (it reads the doc — nothing is pasted):

SDLC-TASK for migration-planner:

CONTEXT (read these before starting):
- docs/DATABASE.md — current schema (the "from" state)
- db/migrations/[next-number]_[feature-slug].sql — the target change db-architect produced

YOUR TASK:
Produce an ordered, reversible migration plan for the existing-table changes in this
feature. Every step has an explicit rollback; every destructive operation (DROP, RENAME,
type change) gets a warning + estimated downtime + a backfill/expand-contract strategy.

PRODUCE exactly:
- docs/features/[feature-slug]/MIGRATION_PLAN.md — ordered steps, each with rollback + risk

When written, print exactly:
"migration plan done — [N steps, M destructive]"
Then stop.
---
```

If API changes needed:

```
---
  HANDOFF → api-designer
---
Write this block to `docs/work/HANDOFF_api-designer.md`, then tell the user: open `/api-design` and have it read `docs/work/HANDOFF_api-designer.md` and follow it (it reads the doc — nothing is pasted):

SDLC-TASK for api-designer:

CONTEXT (read these before starting):
- docs/API_DESIGN.md — existing endpoint contracts this feature extends
- docs/FEATURE_CONTEXT.md — what the feature needs to expose via API

YOUR TASK:
Design the API changes for [feature name]. Changes needed: [describe from impact
analysis]. All changes must be backward-compatible (additive only — new fields,
new endpoints; never remove or rename existing ones).

PRODUCE exactly this:
- Updated docs/API_DESIGN.md — add new endpoint contracts and update any modified
  ones. Each contract must include: HTTP method, path, request body schema, response
  shapes (success + error codes), auth requirements, and backward-compatibility notes

When the file is written, print exactly:
"api done — [one sentence: endpoints added/modified and compatibility status]"
Then stop. Do not ask for follow-up. Do not run additional phases.
---
```

If the feature touches auth, data access, or user input:

```
---
  HANDOFF → security-auditor
---
Write this block to `docs/work/HANDOFF_security-auditor.md`, then tell the user: open `/security` and have it read `docs/work/HANDOFF_security-auditor.md` and follow it (it reads the doc — nothing is pasted):

SDLC-TASK for security-auditor:

CONTEXT (read these before starting):
- docs/FEATURE_CONTEXT.md — what [feature name] does and who can access it
- docs/API_DESIGN.md — the new/modified endpoints for this feature
- docs/DATABASE.md — any new tables or columns being added

YOUR TASK:
Review the design of [feature name] for security risks BEFORE implementation.
This is a design review, not a code audit — look at the intended behaviour, not
existing code. Focus on: broken access control (who should and shouldn't be able
to trigger this feature), injection risks in the new inputs, and auth flow gaps.

PRODUCE exactly this file:
- docs/reviews/SECURITY_DESIGN_<feature>_<date>.md — design-level risks by severity,
  each with: description of the risk, attack scenario, and a concrete mitigation to
  build into the implementation

When the file is written, print exactly:
"security done — [one sentence: risk count by severity and key finding]"
Then stop. Do not ask for follow-up. Do not run additional phases.
---
```

### Backward Compatibility Checklist

Before implementing:
- [ ] API changes are additive (new fields, not removed/renamed)
- [ ] Database migrations are reversible (up + down)
- [ ] Existing tests still pass with new changes
- [ ] No breaking changes to public interfaces
- [ ] If breaking change is unavoidable: version bump + migration guide

### Design Confidence Loop

After producing the design documents:
1. Rate each design document 1-10 (Completeness + Quality)
2. If sequence diagram is < 7: trace more call paths, add error/async flows
3. If test plan is < 7: enumerate specific test cases, not just "add tests for X"
4. Repeat until all scores >= 7

## Step 3: Implement

**1. Create branch, push, and open draft PR immediately (task tool — fast):**
```
task(agent="git-expert", prompt="--feature mode: create branch feat/[slug] from main, push to origin + github, create a draft PR on both Gitea and GitHub titled 'feat([slug]): [feature name]'. Create the draft PR NOW — not after code is written. Draft PR activates CI from commit 1 and keeps work visible. Report branch name and PR URLs.", timeout=60)
```

**2. Write use cases + acceptance tests FIRST (TDD approach):**

Before any implementation, define what "done" looks like:

a) **SDLC lead writes use cases for this feature (INLINE):**
   - Append to `docs/testing/USE_CASES.md` (create if it doesn't exist)
   - One use case per user story / acceptance criterion from FEATURE_CONTEXT.md
   - Each has: persona, preconditions, main flow, alt flows, success criteria
   - Mark all as P0 (this feature must work)

b) **HANDOFF → test-engineer writes the E2E test:**

```
write(filePath="docs/work/sdlc-state.md", content="
Mode: 3 — Feature: [name]
Step: 3 — Implement
Last completed: feature branch created + use cases written
Awaiting: test-engineer — E2E test for this feature (should FAIL initially)
Next after resume: implementation checkpoint
")
```

```
---
  HANDOFF → test-engineer
---
Write this block to `docs/work/HANDOFF_test-engineer.md`, then tell the user: open `/test-expert` and have it read `docs/work/HANDOFF_test-engineer.md` and follow it (it reads the doc — nothing is pasted):

SDLC-TASK for test-engineer:

CONTEXT (read these before starting):
- docs/FEATURE_CONTEXT.md — what [feature name] should do and its acceptance criteria
- docs/testing/USE_CASES.md — the use cases for this feature (just added by SDLC lead)
- docs/testing/TEST_PLAN.md — existing test plan (if it exists)
- docs/TEST_STRATEGY.md — test patterns and frameworks used in this project
- The existing test directory to follow its patterns

YOUR TASK:
Write E2E acceptance tests for [feature name] based on the use cases in
USE_CASES.md. These tests should FAIL initially because the feature isn't
built yet (TDD approach). Cover: the main flow from each use case, error
cases, and key edge cases. Use the shared fixtures helper if one exists.

**Naming convention (MANDATORY for traceability):**
Each test file must have a top-level describe named "UC-NNN: <use case name>" and
each it/test named "AC-N: <acceptance criterion summary>" matching the Given/When/Then
steps from USE_CASES.md. This is how validate-tests-mapping.sh produces UC-level verdicts.

Each test must:
- Create its own fixture data (self-contained)
- Follow the main flow steps from the use case
- Assert the success criteria from the use case
- Include a clean check (no console errors, no 5xx)

PRODUCE exactly these:
- e2e/use-cases/[feature-slug].spec.ts — E2E test(s) for this feature
- Update docs/testing/TEST_PLAN.md — add new test entries

Run the tests. They should FAIL (feature not built yet). Report which
tests fail and why — this becomes the implementation checklist.

Include a completion manifest (see Completion Manifest section).

When all test files are written, print exactly:
"tests done — [N tests written, all failing as expected (feature not built)]"
Then stop. Do not ask for follow-up. Do not run additional phases.
---
```

**3. Implementation checkpoint — after "tests done":**

Test stubs are ready. Design is locked. Time to implement the feature.

```
write(filePath="docs/work/sdlc-state.md", content="
Mode: 3 — Feature: [name]
Step: 3 — Implement
Last completed: test stubs written
Awaiting: developer — feature implementation complete
Next after resume: code-reviewer handoff
")
```

```
---
  IMPLEMENTATION CHECKPOINT
---
Test stubs are ready. Time to implement [feature name].

  Feature context:  docs/FEATURE_CONTEXT.md
  Sequence diagram: [from Step 2 design]
  DB changes:       [migration files from dba handoff, if any]
  API changes:      [updated docs/API_DESIGN.md, if any]
  Tests to pass:    [test files from test-engineer handoff]

Stay within the affected files from the impact analysis.
Follow the existing patterns in docs/PATTERNS.md.
Make tests pass — don't change the tests to fit your implementation.

When the feature is implemented and tests pass, come back and say: "implementation done"
---
```

After "implementation done":
1. **GATE: all feature tests must pass.** Ask user to run the test suite.
   If tests fail, implementation is NOT done — go back and fix.
2. **GATE: all existing P0 tests must still pass** (no regressions).
   If existing tests broke, the feature introduced a regression — fix before review.
3. Only after both gates pass: proceed to code review.

**4. Parallel reviews — fan-out (see Fix-Verify Loop Protocol § Step 1):**

Before emitting, evaluate the auto-trigger rules against the impact analysis:
- **code-reviewer** — ALWAYS runs.
- **security-auditor** — runs if the impact analysis lists any auth, session, authorization, user-input, file-upload, SQL/ORM, crypto, or external-API-with-credentials surface.
- **performance-engineer** — runs if the impact touches a path with an NFR target in SRS.md, DB queries (new or modified), loops over collections, caching, or background jobs.
- **ux-engineer** — runs if any UI file is in the impact.

**These are HANDOFFs — you never read the source and review/scan it yourself.** Write each `docs/work/HANDOFF_<agent>.md`, point the user at the N specialists (`/review-code`, `/security`, …), and read only their produced reports (`FIX_BACKLOG_*` / `SECURITY_FINAL_*`) before synthesis. Report back with all N completion phrases before synthesis.

  PARALLEL REVIEWS — [N] HANDOFFs (open [N] OpenCode sessions)
---

───── HANDOFF #1 → /review-code (code-reviewer) ─────
SDLC-TASK for code-reviewer:
CONTEXT: [feature] implementation files + docs/ARCHITECTURE.md.
YOUR TASK: 9-dimension review (complexity, DRY, error handling, type safety, pattern consistency, naming, comment accuracy, anti-slop, tech-stack compliance — deps match TECH_STACK.md, no tech outside the design). File:line + severity + fix per finding.
PRODUCE: docs/reviews/CODE_REVIEW_<feature>_<date>.md — findings per dimension with severity, verdict (APPROVED / NEEDS REVISION / REJECT), required fixes.
Print exactly: "review done — [verdict and top finding]"

───── HANDOFF #2 → /security (security-auditor)  [if triggered] ─────
SDLC-TASK for security-auditor:
CONTEXT: [feature] implementation files + docs/reviews/SECURITY_DESIGN_<feature>_<date>.md (design-time risks to verify mitigated).
YOUR TASK: Verify every design-time risk is mitigated. Scan for new vulnerabilities (auth, access control, injection, data handling). Produce findings ONLY — do NOT fix.
PRODUCE: docs/reviews/SECURITY_<feature>_<date>.md — file:line + severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW) + fix per finding, verdict (APPROVED / BLOCKED).
Print exactly: "security done — [finding counts + verdict]"

───── HANDOFF #3 → /perf (performance-engineer)  [if triggered] ─────
SDLC-TASK for performance-engineer:
CONTEXT: docs/SRS.md NFR targets + the changed endpoints/queries.
YOUR TASK: Measure baseline and verify against each NFR target. Report findings ONLY — do NOT self-optimize (optimization flows through the remediation HANDOFF). If a target is missed, include a specific fix recommendation with expected delta.
PRODUCE: docs/reviews/PERF_<feature>_<date>.md — baseline, target, measured, PASS/FAIL per target, recommended fix with file:line for each FAIL.
Print exactly: "perf done — [N/M targets pass]"

───── HANDOFF #4 → /ux (ux-engineer)  [if UI-bearing] ─────
SDLC-TASK for ux-engineer:
CONTEXT: [feature] UI changes + docs/design/STYLE_GUIDE.md + docs/design/UX_SPEC.md.
YOUR TASK: Check component conformance + WCAG 2.2 AA + flow vs spec + accessibility regression.
PRODUCE: docs/reviews/UX_REVIEW_<feature>_<date>.md — file:line + severity + fix per finding.
Print exactly: "ux done — [finding counts, CRITICAL/HIGH block merge]"

```

**5. Synthesize → FIX_BACKLOG (see Fix-Verify Loop Protocol § Step 2):**

After every review's completion phrase returns, read each review file and write `docs/reviews/FIX_BACKLOG_<feature>_<date>.md` (format in the protocol). Deduplicate findings that multiple reviewers flagged on the same file:line. Every merge-blocking row MUST have an observable Verify criterion.

**5b. Coverage mini-loop (MANDATORY — scoped Ralph Wiggum, cap 2):**

Before the reviews gate can pass, every source file changed on this branch must be covered by at least one review artifact:

```
bash(command="./scripts/validators/run-coverage-loop.sh feature 2>/dev/null || bash content/validators/run-coverage-loop.sh feature")
```

- **exit 0** — every changed file is covered; continue.
- **exit 1** — read `docs/work/COVERAGE_LOOP_feature_<date>.md`; for each uncovered file emit ONE targeted review HANDOFF (route by file type: code → code-reviewer, query/schema → db-architect via security if auth-touching, UI → ux-engineer). Then re-run the script.
- **exit 2** — cap (2) reached with gaps: emit the escalation block from `agents/shared/RALPH_WIGGUM_LOOP.md` and STOP for user decision.

If the FIX_BACKLOG "Merge-blocking" section is empty AND the coverage loop exits 0 → reviews gate passes. Skip to block 7.

**5.5. Challenge (MANDATORY when any FIX_BACKLOG row is HIGH/CRITICAL):**

Before remediating, emit a **`challenger` HANDOFF** on the review artifact per `agents/shared/CHALLENGER_PROTOCOL.md` (write `docs/work/HANDOFF_challenger.md`, point the user at `/challenge`). It produces `docs/reviews/CHALLENGE_REPORT_<feature>_<date>.md` with per-finding CONFIRMED / CONTRADICTED verdicts. **CONTRADICTED rows are dropped; CONFIRMED rows (+ anything the challenge surfaces) are the backlog the fix-verify loop remediates.** Never skip this on a HIGH/CRITICAL backlog, and never adjudicate the findings yourself. `validate-challenger-gate.sh` fails the phase-4 gate if this report is missing.

**6. Fix-Verify loop (see Fix-Verify Loop Protocol § Steps 3–5):**

Iterate — **tier-aware and class-driven, not a flat 3.** `scripts/fix-verify.mjs` classifies each pass (CLEARED / PROGRESSED / STALLED / OSCILLATING) and reads the ceiling from `docs/work/.model-context` (6 metered / 12 local): STALLED escalates after 2 same-tier attempts; PROGRESSED may extend to the ceiling; OSCILLATING (regressed) escalates immediately, stops on the second.
- Emit the Remediation HANDOFF (coding-agent given the CONFIRMED FIX_BACKLOG) → wait for "fix done".
- Emit the targeted Re-verification HANDOFF (code-reviewer — or original specialist for domain-specific checks) → wait for "verify done".
- If all PASS → reviews gate passes, proceed to block 7.
- If any FAIL → update FIX_BACKLOG with remaining rows, iterate.
- After 3 failed cycles → emit the escalation block (§ Step 5), STOP, wait for user decision [A/B/C/D].
**Autonomy:** If `autonomy: auto` per `agents/shared/AUTONOMY_PROTOCOL.md`: apply the loop-exhaustion default (route to the named specialist, else waiver+continue), logged to `docs/work/APPROVALS.md`.

**7. Git — two steps:**

**7a. Atomic commits (after "implementation done", before reviews):**
```
task(agent="git-expert", prompt="--feature mode (commit phase): analyze the diff for feat/[slug]. Split into atomic conventional commits — one per logical unit. Use git add -p for partial staging. Push to origin + github after committing.", timeout=120)
```

**7b. Mark PR ready + merge (only after RUNTIME PASS + reviews APPROVED + CI green):**
```
task(agent="git-expert", prompt="--feature mode (merge phase): verify RUNTIME_[feature]_<date>.md shows PASS, FIX_BACKLOG is clean, CODE_REVIEW is APPROVED, and CI checks are green on the PR. If all met: mark PR ready, merge with squash, delete branch. Report merge SHA.", timeout=120)
```

Note: The draft PR was created in Step 3.1 when the branch was first pushed. Step 7 only handles commits and merge — not branch creation.

**Verify modular structure:**
- New code follows existing patterns
- Dependencies are injected, not hardcoded
- New module has clear public API
- No god functions (keep under 50 lines)

## Step 4: Verify

Reviews ran in Step 3 as a parallel fan-out and flowed through the Fix-Verify Loop. Step 4 is now just the final pre-merge sanity checks:

- Run full test suite (existing + new tests pass — no regressions)
- Confirm `FIX_BACKLOG_<feature>_<date>.md` exists and its "Merge-blocking" section is either empty or every row has a PASS in the latest `VERIFY_<feature>_<iteration>_<date>.md`
- Confirm no CRITICAL/HIGH waivers were signed without a compensating control documented in `WAIVERS_<feature>_<date>.md`
- Check: Does the feature work end-to-end? (this is verified by the runtime gate in Step 5)
- Check: Did we break anything? (regression test)

## Step 5: Document

Update existing docs to reflect the new feature:
- Update ARCHITECTURE.md if component structure changed
- Update API docs if endpoints changed
- Add sequence diagram for the new flow
- **If UI feature:** update `docs/design/UX_SPEC.md` to include the new workflow and any new components added
- Update ONBOARDING.md "How to Add a Feature" if patterns changed

**Commit updated docs (task tool — fast):**
```
task(agent="git-expert", prompt="Commit any updated docs/ files from this feature (ARCHITECTURE.md, API docs, sequence diagrams, UX_SPEC.md if changed). Conventional commit: 'docs(feature/[name]): update architecture and UX docs to reflect [feature name]'. Push to the feature branch.", timeout=60)
```

**Runtime validation gate — the product must actually run (BLOCKING):**

Tests green and reviews approved do not prove the app boots. Missing env vars,
broken migrations, import cycles, bad container wiring, and UI regressions all
surface only at runtime. **Do not merge until a clean run is confirmed.**

**The orchestrator runs operational validators directly — no agent self-report.** Each script auto-detects the project's stack (node/python/rust/go) and runs the actual build/lint/test/smoke/deps tools. Override via `.sdlc/sdlc.json` for non-standard commands. Each writes `docs/reviews/RUNTIME_<kind>_<date>.md` with verdict + tail output.

```bash
# Run sequentially, stop on first failure
content/validators/validate-build.sh             # build the project
content/validators/validate-lint.sh              # lint + typecheck
content/validators/validate-tests.sh             # full test suite
content/validators/validate-smoke.sh             # boot server, hit known routes
content/validators/validate-deps.sh              # CVE / advisory check
content/validators/validate-code-health.sh       # anti-slop + complexity gates
content/validators/validate-module-boundaries.sh # cross-module import enforcement
```

For a feature-scoped validation, the orchestrator can also delegate the FEATURE SMOKE and REGRESSION SMOKE steps to coding-agent:

```
task(agent="coding-agent", prompt="Runtime feature smoke for feat/[slug]:
 1. FEATURE SMOKE — exercise the happy path of [feature name] end-to-end (HTTP request, UI click-through via the browser if frontend, CLI call). Verify behavior matches the acceptance criteria.
 2. REGRESSION SMOKE — exercise 1-2 unrelated golden paths that existed before this feature to confirm no regression.
 Append to docs/reviews/RUNTIME_smoke_<date>.md (created by validate-smoke.sh) with feature-specific assertions.
 Print exactly: 'feature-smoke done — [PASS or FAIL, one sentence]' then stop.", timeout=600)
```

**If verdict is FAIL: DO NOT MERGE.** Return to implementation, fix the defects,
re-run reviews if the fix is non-trivial, then re-run this gate. A feature that
does not run cleanly is not done — shipping it to `main` is a P0 defect.

**Mark PR ready + merge to `main` (task tool — fast, only after runtime PASS):**
Runtime PASS confirmed and all reviews approved — promote the PR from draft to ready and merge:
```
task(agent="git-expert", prompt="Run --feature mode (merge phase): confirm docs/reviews/RUNTIME_<feature>_<date>.md exists with verdict PASS — if missing or FAIL, abort and report. Then mark the feat/[slug] PR as ready for review (remove draft status). After merge approval, merge the branch into main using squash merge. Delete the feature branch after merge. Confirm the merge SHA.", timeout=120)
```

After the merge is confirmed: announce to the user "Feature `[name]` merged to main (runtime PASS, merge SHA [sha]). Run `/sdlc gate` to check if a release is ready."
