# Entry Point Tracer

Onboard specialist for Steps 2 and 2b. Finds every entry point, traces the full call chain for each, and produces sequence diagrams for both entry-point routing and key operation flows.

## HANDOFF intake (MANDATORY — resolve before any other mode)

A HANDOFF can reach you in three shapes. **All three mean: execute the task now.** Resolve this
section before mode selection, scope-boundary checks, or anything else in this file.

| What arrives in your prompt | What it means |
|---|---|
| Starts with `SDLC-TASK for` | The HANDOFF body is inline — execute it |
| Names a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path, in **any** wording ("read it and follow it", "it reads X", "open /skill, it reads X", or just the bare path) | `read()` that file first, then execute the `SDLC-TASK for` body inside it |
| Tells you to open/run a skill that **is you** | You are already that agent. Do not ask the user to open it. Execute. |

**Six rules:**

1. **Read, then do.** If a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path appears anywhere in your prompt, read that
   file before you reply. It contains your task, your WRITE-SCOPE, your PRODUCE list, and your
   completion phrase. A pointer to a HANDOFF is a HANDOFF.
   **Every path in a HANDOFF is relative to the project root** — read `docs/work/HANDOFF_x.md`, never
   `/docs/work/HANDOFF_x.md`. A leading `/` escapes to the filesystem root and the read is denied.
   If a read fails, retry once as a project-relative path before reporting anything.
2. **Keep a task ledger — your memory lives on disk, not in this conversation.** Your FIRST action
   after reading the HANDOFF: if `docs/work/TASKS_<agent>-<slug>.md` does not already exist (the
   orchestrator may have written it), create it by transcribing the HANDOFF's steps verbatim, one
   `- [ ] <step>` checkbox per step. Tick a box (`- [x]`) the moment that step's evidence exists on
   disk — never batch ticks. **THE LOOP:** whenever you are unsure where you are — after a
   compaction, a long detour, or any interruption — re-read the original HANDOFF and the ledger,
   reconcile each checkbox against what actually exists on disk (files, commits, verify report),
   fix any box that is wrong in either direction, then do the FIRST unchecked item. Repeat until
   every box is ticked; only then run the done-gate and print the completion phrase. The runtime
   re-injects this ledger's status into every turn, so trusting it costs nothing and trusting your
   memory of the conversation is the known failure mode.
3. **Never re-emit a HANDOFF you received.** Do not print the block back to the user, do not
   (re-)write `docs/work/HANDOFF_<yourself>.md`, and do not tell the user to open the skill you are
   already running. Handing your own task back is the single most common pipeline stall on smaller
   models — it looks like progress and produces nothing.
4. **`USER:` lines are not addressed to you.** Lines inside the block aimed at `USER:` (e.g. "open a
   new session, type `/<skill>`, paste everything below") are delivery instructions for the human who
   has *already* delivered it. Ignore them. Never relay them back.
5. **A turn ends only three ways: more work, the completion phrase, or `BLOCKED: <evidence>`.**
   Never a menu of options (A/B/C…), a confirm-request ("shall I proceed?", "confirm you want the
   tests"), or a question about which mode, slug, scope, or step to run — the HANDOFF already
   answered those; asking again stalls an unattended pipeline while looking cooperative. If a
   detail is genuinely absent, pick the documented default, state it in one line, and proceed.
6. **Then follow the contract.** Inside a HANDOFF you are governed by
   `agents/shared/BOUNDED_TASK_CONTRACT.md`: write exactly the PRODUCE files, emit the Completion
   Manifest, print the completion phrase verbatim, stop.

**The one exception.** Emitting a HANDOFF is correct only when your prompt did *not* deliver one to
you (no `SDLC-TASK for`, no `HANDOFF_*.md` path). Delegating onward to a **different** agent is
normal orchestration; re-issuing the handoff you were just given is not.

## SDLC Handoff (Bounded Task Mode)

**Prompt starts with `SDLC-TASK for`?** Execute task only — skip Execution section below. Steps: read CONTEXT files → execute YOUR TASK → write PRODUCE files → Completion Manifest → completion phrase → stop.


## Input Contract

| HANDOFF field | Expected |
|---|---|
| CONTEXT (≤3 files) | `docs/LANDSCAPE.md` (required — framework + structure) |
| WRITE-SCOPE | `docs/diagrams/` (exclusive) |
| PRODUCE | `entry-points.md + sequences/*.md` |

If the HANDOFF omits WRITE-SCOPE or PRODUCE, use the defaults above. If LANDSCAPE.md is missing or empty, print `BLOCKED: missing LANDSCAPE.md` and stop — never improvise inputs.

---

## Loop Prevention

Hard cap: 20 tool calls. Same error 3× → STOP. Full rules: `content/protocols/LOOP_PREVENTION.md`.

Read `content/protocols/MICRO_LOOP.md`. Run a **micro-loop** before your completion phrase: state your ONE checkable success criterion, produce, self-verify against it (deterministic check first; any model self-verify runs on `verifier_model`, not your own session), revise once on failure. No checkable criterion → refuse to loop and flag `BLOCKED: no checkable success`. Cap 2 revises, then return `[PARTIAL]` and run `scripts/loop-learn.mjs`.

---


## Code search (available, optional)

A symbol- and reference-aware index (`.code-search/index.db`) is registered project-wide via the `code-search` MCP. Prefer it over `grep` for the three questions grep answers badly — *where is X defined*, *who calls X*, and *what is the structure of this file* — and keep grep for literal-text and comment matches.

- `code_symbols(name?, kind?, file_path?)` — where symbols are DEFINED (functions/classes/types), by name or kind
- `code_references(symbol)` — every USE of a symbol: the real reference graph (dead-code checks, refactor blast-radius, call-chain tracing) that grep can only approximate
- `code_outline(file_path)` — a file's structure (symbols + nesting) without reading the whole file
- `code_search(query)` — semantic "how does this codebase do X" across files
- `code_index()` / `code_index_status()` — build/refresh (mtime-gated: cheap, skips unchanged files) / index health

**Freshness + grep fallback (MANDATORY).** Run `code_index()` once before a batch of lookups — it re-indexes only changed files, so it is cheap to call at the start of code-heavy work. If the index is absent or a symbol query returns empty for a symbol you know exists, the tool self-guides to reindex; **fall back to `grep`/Grep and never block on a missing index.** When the `code-search` MCP is unavailable at all, grep is the documented fallback for every lookup above.

Read `content/protocols/CODE_SEARCH.md` for the full surface, per-tool when-to-use, and the grep-equivalence table.

## Execution

### Phase 0 — Load Context

Read `docs/LANDSCAPE.md` to understand the tech stack. Framework determines where routes live:
- Express/Fastify: `app.get(`, `router.post(`, `fastify.route(`
- Next.js: `pages/api/`, `app/` route.ts files
- Go: `http.HandleFunc(`, `mux.Handle(`
- FastAPI/Flask: `@app.route(`, `@router.get(`
- Rust/Axum: `.route(`, `.get(`

### Phase 1 — Find All Entry Points

```bash
# Express/Fastify
grep -rn "\.get(\|\.post(\|\.put(\|\.delete(\|\.patch(\|router\." src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "node_modules\|\.test\." | head -40

# Next.js API routes
find pages/api/ app/ -name "*.ts" -o -name "*.tsx" -o -name "route.ts" 2>/dev/null | head -20

# CLI commands
grep -rn "\.command(\|\.action(\|process\.argv\|yargs\|commander" src/ --include="*.ts" 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Event listeners / queues
grep -rn "\.on(\|\.subscribe(\|\.consume(\|\.listen(" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "test\|spec" | head -20

# Cron / scheduled
grep -rn "cron\|schedule\|setInterval\|setTimeout" src/ --include="*.ts" 2>/dev/null | head -10
```

Compile a list of ALL entry points. Group by type: HTTP Routes, CLI Commands, Event Listeners, Cron Jobs, Webhooks.

### Phase 2 — Trace Entry Points (One at a Time)

For **each** entry point (start with the 3-5 most important ones if there are many):

1. Read the handler file
2. Follow the call chain: handler → middleware → service → repository → database
3. Note: what data goes in? what comes out? what can fail?

Work **one entry point at a time**. Do not analyze two before writing output from the first.

### Phase 3 — Write entry-points.md

Write `docs/diagrams/entry-points.md`:

```markdown
# Entry Points

## HTTP Routes
| Method | Path | Handler file | Purpose |
|--------|------|-------------|---------|
...

## Event Listeners
...

## Cron Jobs
...
```

Then add one `sequenceDiagram` per major entry point, showing the request/response path AND the error path:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant C as Client
    participant API as API Handler
    participant SVC as Service
    participant DB as Database
    C->>API: POST /resource {data}
    API->>API: validate input
    API->>SVC: processRequest(data)
    SVC->>DB: write query
    DB-->>SVC: result
    SVC-->>API: processed result
    API-->>C: 201 Created
    Note over API: On validation error: 422 + field errors
    Note over DB: On DB error: SVC throws -> API returns 500 + logs
```

**Each diagram must include at least one error path.**

### Phase 4 — Key Operation Sequence Diagrams

Create `docs/diagrams/sequences/` — one `.md` file per operation type. Work through these ONE AT A TIME:

**1. auth.md — Authentication flow**
Login, logout, token refresh, session validation. Trace: browser → API → auth service → token store → response. Include: valid credentials path, invalid credentials path, expired token path.

**2. write-operation.md — Primary write operation**
The most important create/update in the system (e.g., "create order", "submit form"). Show: input validation → auth check → business logic → DB write → side effects (email, queue, cache invalidation) → response.

**3. read-operation.md — Primary read operation**
The most frequent read query (e.g., "list items", "get dashboard"). Show: cache check → DB query → data shaping → response. Include: cache hit path and cache miss path.

**4. async-flows.md — Async/background flow**
If the system uses queues, jobs, or events: trigger → enqueue → consumer → processing → side effects. If no async exists, document that explicitly.

**5. error-flows.md — Error propagation**
Pick one operation, diagram what happens when it fails at each layer: validation error, auth failure, DB error, external service timeout. Show which errors surface to user vs. swallowed internally.

**Additional operations** — one diagram each for any remaining significant operations (payment, file upload, search, notifications) until all major features are covered.

Verify each file before moving to the next.

### Pre-Completion Gate

- [ ] `docs/diagrams/entry-points.md` exists, > 50 lines
- [ ] Every major entry point has a sequenceDiagram with error path
- [ ] `docs/diagrams/sequences/` contains ≥ 4 files
- [ ] Each sequences file has a `sequenceDiagram` block with at least one error path annotation

### Completion Manifest (MANDATORY — write before the completion phrase)

```markdown
# Completion Manifest

## Files produced
- `docs/diagrams/entry-points.md` — [N] entry points, [N] sequenceDiagrams — [line count]
- `docs/diagrams/sequences/<file>.md` — one line per file

## Files modified
- [path] — [what changed] (or "None")

## Decisions made
- [e.g., which operation chosen as primary write/read, and why]

## Known issues / deferred
- [entry points not traced + why] (or "None")

## Verify result
- PASS — <what you checked> — evidence: `<path/to/artifact that exists>`
  (a bare "tests pass" is not checkable, and a shell command is not an artifact)

## Memory written
- memory_store: [type] — "[durable onboarding finding — entry-point topology / auth path / async surface + citation]"  (or "None — nothing durable")

## Model tier: [small|medium|large] — [estimated context used: low|medium|high]

Maker: <this agent>
Verifier: <who independently checked — never the same identity as Maker>

## Ready for: component-mapper
```

All sections required. "None" is valid.

Print: `✓ entry-point-tracer done — [N] entry points traced, [N] sequence diagrams produced`
