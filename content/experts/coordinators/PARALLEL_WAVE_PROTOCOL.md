# Parallel Wave Protocol

Load this when the user has chosen parallel mode (`[P]`) for a Phase 4 wave. Sequential mode does NOT need this file.

---

## Overview

A parallel wave runs THREE rounds per module: **code → review → runtime**. Every module produces its own `CODE_REVIEW_<module>_<date>.md` and `RUNTIME_<module>_<date>.md`. A wave does not advance until every module has its own runtime verdict `PASS`.

---

## Round 1 — Code (N parallel coding-agent HANDOFFs)

Emit ONE message containing every coding HANDOFF for the wave. Example for a 3-module wave:

```
---
  WAVE 2 — ROUND 1: CODE (3 HANDOFFs — open 3 OpenCode sessions)
---
These 3 modules are independent — no shared write-scope, no cross-module imports.
Open three separate OpenCode sessions and paste ONE handoff prompt into each.
Report back with all three completion phrases before I emit Round 2.

Write-scope (ENFORCED):
  HANDOFF #1 (coding-agent → auth):          src/auth/           ONLY
  HANDOFF #2 (coding-agent → users):         src/users/          ONLY
  HANDOFF #3 (coding-agent → notifications): src/notifications/  ONLY

If any agent needs to change a file outside its assigned directory, it MUST
stop and flag the cross-cutting concern — do not edit cross-module.

───── HANDOFF #1 ─────
[coding-agent prompt for module 1 — completion phrase: "code done — auth module: [summary]"]
───── HANDOFF #2 ─────
[coding-agent prompt for module 2 — completion phrase: "code done — users module: [summary]"]
───── HANDOFF #3 ─────
[coding-agent prompt for module 3 — completion phrase: "code done — notifications module: [summary]"]
---
```

**Round 1 gate:** every module's completion phrase present, no write-scope collisions (`git status` shows no overlap).

---

## Round 2 — Review (N parallel HANDOFFs + Fix-Verify Loop per module)

Emit ONE message with every triggered review HANDOFF per module:
- code-reviewer: always
- security: if auth or input handling touched
- perf: if DB queries or loops touched
- ux: if UI components touched

Completion phrases: `"review done — <module>: <verdict>"`, `"security done — <module>: <verdict>"`, etc.

After all completion phrases return, run the Fix-Verify Loop Protocol **per module**:
- Each module produces its own `FIX_BACKLOG_<module>_<date>.md`
- Iterate up to 3 times: remediation + re-verification per module
- A module passes when every merge-blocking row in its backlog is `VERIFY=PASS`
- A module stuck after 3 iterations emits its own escalation block — peer modules advance to Round 3

---

## Round 3 — Runtime (N parallel coding-agent HANDOFFs)

Emit ONE message with N runtime-validation HANDOFFs, one per module. Each runs the full runtime gate scoped to its module:
- build → lint/typecheck → start → module-level smoke → regression smoke
- Produces: `docs/reviews/RUNTIME_<module>_<date>.md`
- Completion phrase: `"runtime done — <module>: [PASS or FAIL]"`

**Round 3 gate — per module:**
1. Module's RUNTIME_<module>.md shows PASS
2. Module's FIX_BACKLOG_<module>.md has 0 open CRITICAL/HIGH
3. `run-handoff-gates.sh` scope check clean for this module

A module that fails Round 3 blocks only itself — fix that module and re-run its Round 3 HANDOFF while other modules' PASS verdicts remain valid.

---

## Wave Gate (mandatory before Wave N+1)

1. Every module in the wave has RUNTIME PASS and clean FIX_BACKLOG
2. No write-scope collisions: `git status --porcelain` — no overlap between modules
3. Update `docs/PARALLELIZATION_MAP.md`: mark wave DONE
4. Update SDLC_TRACKER Phase 4 Wave Execution row: `Status = ✅ DONE`

Print before advancing:
```
WAVE [N] COMPLETE ✓
  Modules: [list] — all RUNTIME PASS, all FIX_BACKLOGs clean
  Advancing to Wave [N+1]: [modules]
  [or: All waves complete — running Phase 4 pre-gate checklist]
```

---

## When to Refuse Parallel and Force Sequential

- The wave contains any module that writes to `src/shared/`, `src/common/`, or root-level config (tsconfig, package.json, etc.)
- Two modules in the wave both depend on a contract that hasn't been frozen yet
- `PARALLELIZATION_MAP.md` lists the modules in different waves (don't cross wave boundaries for convenience)

---

## State Save (before emitting parallel HANDOFFs)

```
write(filePath="docs/work/sdlc-state.md", content="
Mode: 1 / Phase: 4 — Wave [N] (parallel)
Last completed: Wave [N-1] verified
Awaiting: coding-agent × [M modules] — see HANDOFFs below
Next after resume: verify each, gate wave, advance to Wave [N+1]
")
```
