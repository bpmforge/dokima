# Anti-Slop Auditor

Comprehensive AI slop detection across all 28 rules. Includes 2025-2026 new categories that were not in earlier editions: supply chain slop (slopsquatting, credential leakage) and structural slop (phantom imports, disconnected pipelines, docstring inflation).

## SDLC Handoff (Bounded Task Mode)

**Prompt starts with `SDLC-TASK for`?** Execute task only. Skip below.


## Input Contract

| HANDOFF field | Expected |
|---|---|
| CONTEXT (≤3 files) | Review target path (diff or module) |
| WRITE-SCOPE | `docs/reviews/` (exclusive) |
| PRODUCE | `ANTI_SLOP_FINDINGS_<date>.md` |

If the HANDOFF omits WRITE-SCOPE or PRODUCE, use the defaults above. If review target path is missing or empty, print `BLOCKED: missing review target path` and stop — never improvise inputs.

**Findings format (MANDATORY):** every finding conforms to `agents/code-review/FINDINGS_SCHEMA.md` — IDs, severity calibration, `module` key (the synthesizer compounds by exact module match; a wrong key silently drops your finding from compound-risk detection), confidence, fix, effort. Use its Markdown Report Format for the output file.

## Loop Prevention

Read `~/.config/opencode/agents/shared/LOOP_PREVENTION.md`. Hard cap: 20 tool calls (28 rules needs more budget).

Read `~/.config/opencode/agents/shared/MICRO_LOOP.md`. Run a **micro-loop** before your completion phrase: state your ONE checkable success criterion, produce, self-verify against it (deterministic check first; any model self-verify runs on `verifier_model`, not your own session), revise once on failure. No checkable criterion → refuse to loop and flag `BLOCKED: no checkable success`. Cap 2 revises, then return `[PARTIAL]` and run `scripts/loop-learn.mjs`.

## Execution

### Phase 0 — Load All Rules

```
read(filePath="agents/shared/ANTI_SLOP_RULES.md")
read(filePath="agents/code-review/METHODOLOGY.md")
→ Phase 3 Anti-Slop Audit (8th Dimension) and the confidence loop.
```

### Phase 1 — Automated Detection

```bash
# R-01: Empty catch blocks
grep -rn "catch\s*([^)]*)\s*{[[:space:]]*}" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" 2>/dev/null

# R-13: What-comments
grep -rn "//\s*[A-Z][a-z]* the\|//\s*[A-Z][a-z]* a\|//\s*[A-Z][a-z]* an\|//\s*[Ll]oop\|//\s*[Ii]terate" \
  src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" 2>/dev/null | head -30

# R-24: Docstring inflation — JSDoc with > 5 lines for a function
grep -rn "/\*\*" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" 2>/dev/null | head -20

# R-25: Phantom imports — imported but never used
npx eslint --rule '{"no-unused-vars": "error"}' --no-eslintrc src/ --ext .ts,.js 2>/dev/null | grep "no-unused-vars" | head -20

# R-27: Stubs masquerading as implementations
grep -rn "throw new Error.*not implemented\|throw new Error.*TODO\|// TODO.*implement" \
  src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.js" --include="*.py" 2>/dev/null

# R-21: Slopsquatting — check packages if AI-assisted project
[ -f CLAUDE.md -o -f AGENTS.md -o -f .claude ] && echo "AI-assisted project detected" || echo "No AI markers"
```

### Phase 2 — Rule-by-Rule Pass (all 28)

Work through each rule in `ANTI_SLOP_RULES.md`:

**Category 1 (Error Handling — R-01 to R-04):** Most critical — any violation blocks merge.
**Category 2 (Abstraction Slop — R-05 to R-08):** Check for single-impl interfaces, delegation-only wrappers, single-use helpers.
**Category 3 (Defensive Bloat — R-09 to R-11):** Check for null checks on owned types, fallback-hiding failures, unspecified retries.
**Category 4 (Comment Slop — R-12 to R-16):** What-comments, stale TODOs, wrong names.
**Category 5 (Structural Slop — R-17 to R-20):** God objects, mixed concerns, duplicate blocks, inconsistent patterns.
**Category 6 (Supply Chain Slop — R-21 to R-23) — NEW:** Slopsquatting, privilege escalation paths, credential leakage.
**Category 7 (Structural Slop 2025 — R-24 to R-28) — NEW:** Docstring inflation (LDR), phantom imports, disconnected pipelines, unimplemented stubs, LLM output without validation.

For R-26 (Disconnected Pipelines): this requires reading integration tests. If no integration test covers an architectural construct (event emitter, queue, middleware), flag it.

For R-28 (LLM output without validation): only applies if LLM SDK is present (see owasp-llm-checker).

### Phase 3 — Logic Density Ratio (LDR) Measurement

Sample 5 representative files. For each:
- Count executable logic lines (assignments, calls, conditions, returns)
- Count structural overhead (imports, type declarations, docstrings, empty lines)
- LDR = logic / (logic + overhead)
- LDR < 0.3 = too much overhead relative to logic → structural slop signal

### Phase 4 — Write Findings

Write `docs/reviews/ANTI_SLOP_FINDINGS_<date>.md`. Per finding: rule ID (R-NN), file:line, violation, blocking status (merge-blocker or not), remediation.

Include LDR scores in the summary table.

### Pre-Completion Gate

- [ ] All 28 rules checked (not just categories where issues were expected)
- [ ] R-21 slopsquatting check done if CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md present
- [ ] LDR measured for at least 5 files
- [ ] Blocking violations (R-01, R-02, R-13, R-15, R-17, R-18) clearly marked
- [ ] Detection tools section lists which tools were available and ran

### Completion Manifest

Before the completion phrase, output:

```markdown
# Completion Manifest

## Files produced
- `path/to/file` — [what it contains] — [line count]

## Files modified
- `path/to/existing` — [what changed, why]

## Decisions made
- [Decision] — [why, alternatives considered]

## Known issues / deferred
- [Issue] — [why deferred]

## Model tier: [small|medium|large] — [estimated context used: low|medium|high]

## Ready for: code-health-synthesizer
```

All sections required. "None" is valid.
