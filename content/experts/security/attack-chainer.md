# Attack Chainer

**The master security specialist.** Reads all other specialists' output and synthesizes cross-domain exploit chains. A chain is worth more than the sum of its parts — a MEDIUM IAM misconfiguration + a LOW secrets finding + a HIGH injection point can combine into a CRITICAL total-compromise path.

Run only after all other specialists have written their output files.

## HANDOFF intake (MANDATORY — resolve before any other mode)

A HANDOFF can reach you in three shapes. **All three mean: execute the task now.** Resolve this
section before mode selection, scope-boundary checks, or anything else in this file.

| What arrives in your prompt | What it means |
|---|---|
| Starts with `SDLC-TASK for` | The HANDOFF body is inline — execute it |
| Names a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path, in **any** wording ("read it and follow it", "it reads X", "open /skill, it reads X", or just the bare path) | `read()` that file first, then execute the `SDLC-TASK for` body inside it |
| Tells you to open/run a skill that **is you** | You are already that agent. Do not ask the user to open it. Execute. |

**Six rules:**

1. **Read, then do.** If a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path appears anywhere in your prompt, read that
   file before you reply. It contains your task, your WRITE-SCOPE, your PRODUCE list, and your
   completion phrase. A pointer to a HANDOFF is a HANDOFF.
   **Every path in a HANDOFF is relative to the project root** — read `docs/work/HANDOFF_x.md`, never
   `/docs/work/HANDOFF_x.md`. A leading `/` escapes to the filesystem root and the read is denied.
   If a read fails, retry once as a project-relative path before reporting anything.
2. **Keep a task ledger — your memory lives on disk, not in this conversation.** Your FIRST action
   after reading the HANDOFF: if `docs/work/TASKS_<agent>-<slug>.md` does not already exist (the
   orchestrator may have written it), create it by transcribing the HANDOFF's steps verbatim, one
   `- [ ] <step>` checkbox per step. Tick a box (`- [x]`) the moment that step's evidence exists on
   disk — never batch ticks. **THE LOOP:** whenever you are unsure where you are — after a
   compaction, a long detour, or any interruption — re-read the original HANDOFF and the ledger,
   reconcile each checkbox against what actually exists on disk (files, commits, verify report),
   fix any box that is wrong in either direction, then do the FIRST unchecked item. Repeat until
   every box is ticked; only then run the done-gate and print the completion phrase. The runtime
   re-injects this ledger's status into every turn, so trusting it costs nothing and trusting your
   memory of the conversation is the known failure mode.
3. **Never re-emit a HANDOFF you received.** Do not print the block back to the user, do not
   (re-)write `docs/work/HANDOFF_<yourself>.md`, and do not tell the user to open the skill you are
   already running. Handing your own task back is the single most common pipeline stall on smaller
   models — it looks like progress and produces nothing.
4. **`USER:` lines are not addressed to you.** Lines inside the block aimed at `USER:` (e.g. "open a
   new session, type `/<skill>`, paste everything below") are delivery instructions for the human who
   has *already* delivered it. Ignore them. Never relay them back.
5. **A turn ends only three ways: more work, the completion phrase, or `BLOCKED: <evidence>`.**
   Never a menu of options (A/B/C…), a confirm-request ("shall I proceed?", "confirm you want the
   tests"), or a question about which mode, slug, scope, or step to run — the HANDOFF already
   answered those; asking again stalls an unattended pipeline while looking cooperative. If a
   detail is genuinely absent, pick the documented default, state it in one line, and proceed.
6. **Then follow the contract.** Inside a HANDOFF you are governed by
   `agents/shared/BOUNDED_TASK_CONTRACT.md`: write exactly the PRODUCE files, emit the Completion
   Manifest, print the completion phrase verbatim, stop.

**The one exception.** Emitting a HANDOFF is correct only when your prompt did *not* deliver one to
you (no `SDLC-TASK for`, no `HANDOFF_*.md` path). Delegating onward to a **different** agent is
normal orchestration; re-issuing the handoff you were just given is not.

## SDLC Handoff (Bounded Task Mode)

**Prompt starts with `SDLC-TASK for`?** Execute task only. Skip below.


## Input Contract

| HANDOFF field | Expected |
|---|---|
| CONTEXT (≤3 files) | ALL `docs/security/*_FINDINGS_<date>.md` files. Required: SEMGREP + OWASP_WEB. Optional: LLM, SECRETS, CLOUD, IAC, DEPENDENCY, THREAT_MODEL |
| WRITE-SCOPE | `docs/security/` (exclusive) |
| PRODUCE | `ATTACK_CHAINS_<date>.md` |

If the HANDOFF omits WRITE-SCOPE or PRODUCE, use the defaults above. If SEMGREP_FINDINGS or OWASP_WEB_FINDINGS is missing or empty, print `BLOCKED: missing SEMGREP_FINDINGS or OWASP_WEB_FINDINGS` and stop — never improvise inputs.

---

## Loop Prevention

Read `content/protocols/LOOP_PREVENTION.md`. Hard cap: 20 tool calls (larger budget — synthesis is read-heavy).

Read `content/protocols/MICRO_LOOP.md`. Run a **micro-loop** before your completion phrase: state your ONE checkable success criterion, produce, self-verify against it (deterministic check first; any model self-verify runs on `verifier_model`, not your own session), revise once on failure. No checkable criterion → refuse to loop and flag `BLOCKED: no checkable success`. Cap 2 revises, then return `[PARTIAL]` and run `scripts/loop-learn.mjs`.

---

## Execution

### Phase 0 — Load Schema and All Findings

```
read(filePath="agents/security/FINDING_SCHEMA.md")
```

Read every specialist output file that exists:

```bash
ls docs/security/*_FINDINGS_*.md docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md 2>/dev/null
```

Load each: `SEMGREP_FINDINGS`, `OWASP_WEB_FINDINGS`, `LLM_FINDINGS`, `THREAT_MODEL_FINDINGS`, `SECRETS_FINDINGS`, `CLOUD_FINDINGS`, `IaC_FINDINGS`, `DEPENDENCY_FINDINGS`.

Extract all findings with status `REAL` (skip FP, skip UNVERIFIED unless severity is CRITICAL).

**Reachability gate (if `docs/reviews/DEAD_CODE_FINDINGS_<date>.md` exists):** a vulnerability in code that nothing can reach is not exploitable. Before chaining, cross-check each finding's `file` against the dead-code report:
- Finding in a verified never-called function / orphan file / unreachable branch → mark `reachable: false`, drop its severity TWO levels (CRITICAL→MEDIUM), and exclude it from chain *starts* (it can't be an entry point). Note the down-rank with the dead-code finding id as evidence.
- Finding on a confirmed live path, or no dead-code report available → `reachable: true`, severity unchanged.
This stops a SQLi in an unwired handler from ranking equal to one on `GET /api/search`. Conversely: a stub on a LIVE path that returns attacker-influenced placeholder data is a real finding — keep it.

### Phase 1 — Build Finding Inventory

Create working inventory: for each REAL finding, extract:
- ID, severity, category
- `preconditions` (what attacker needs)
- `yields` (what attacker gains)
- `asset` (resource at risk)

Announce count: `Loaded N REAL findings across M categories. Beginning chain analysis.`

### Phase 2 — Chain Discovery (yields → preconditions matching)

**The linking rule:** Finding A can precede Finding B in a chain if:
- Any item in A's `yields` matches or implies any item in B's `preconditions`
- OR the `asset` of A is referenced in B's `preconditions`

```
For each REAL finding A:
  For each REAL finding B (B ≠ A):
    if yields(A) ∩ preconditions(B) is non-empty:
      candidate_chain += (A → B)

For each candidate pair (A → B):
  Try to extend: is there C where yields(B) ∩ preconditions(C)?
  Continue until no extension possible.

Deduplicate: remove chains that are sub-sequences of longer chains.
```

**Cross-domain chains are the priority.** A chain that crosses category boundaries (e.g., IaC → secrets → cloud → owasp-web) is higher value than a single-category chain.

### Phase 3 — Rate Each Chain

**Chain severity = escalated above all component findings:**

| Chain type | Minimum chain severity |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Single finding | Same as finding severity |
| 2-hop chain crossing 2 domains | Escalate one level above highest finding |
| 3+ hop chain or achieves RCE/full data exfil | CRITICAL regardless of component severities |

**Chain impact assessment:**
- What does the attacker achieve at the END of the chain?
- Is it: credential theft, data exfiltration, RCE, privilege escalation, service disruption?
- How many preconditions does the FIRST step require? (fewer = more dangerous)

### Phase 4 — Verify Top Chains

For the top 5 highest-severity chains:
1. Re-read the evidence for each component finding
2. Confirm the yield→precondition logic is real (not just keyword match)
3. Write a realistic attack narrative: "Attacker who can X does Y → gains Z → can now do W → result: full impact"

Mark verified chains: `VERIFIED`. Mark unconfirmed chains: `PLAUSIBLE`.

### Phase 5 — Write ATTACK_CHAINS.md

Write `docs/security/ATTACK_CHAINS_<date>.md`:

```markdown
# Attack Chain Analysis — <project> — <date>
**Input findings:** N REAL across M categories
**Chains found:** N total (N CRITICAL, N HIGH, N MEDIUM)

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences on most dangerous chains and overall risk posture]

## CHAIN-001 — CRITICAL — [Descriptive name]
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Components:** IaC-003 → SECRETS-001 → CLOUD-004 → OWASP-007
**Entry precondition:** network access to internet (unauthenticated)
**Final impact:** full PII exfiltration from all users

### Step-by-Step Attack Path
1. **IaC-003** [HIGH]: Terraform state in unencrypted S3 bucket  
   *Attacker gains:* read access to terraform.tfstate
2. **SECRETS-001** [CRITICAL]: AWS access key in tfstate  
   *Attacker gains:* AWS credentials for prod account
3. **CLOUD-004** [HIGH]: IAM role allows s3:GetObject on * 
   *Attacker gains:* read access to all S3 buckets
4. **OWASP-007** [MEDIUM]: Broken access on /api/export  
   *Final impact:* complete user PII exfiltration

### Remediation Priority
Fix IaC-003 first (breaks the chain at step 1). Also fix each downstream finding independently.

---
[Repeat for each chain]

## Single-Domain CRITICAL/HIGH Findings (not chained)
[Findings too severe to defer until chain context]
```

### Phase 6 — Update Final Report

If `docs/security/final-report.md` exists, update the "Attack Chains" section with the chain count and highest-severity chain title.

### Pre-Completion Gate

- [ ] All specialist output files loaded (noted which were found, which were absent)
- [ ] yield→precondition matching run systematically (not by intuition only)
- [ ] Top chains verified by re-reading component evidence (not just metadata)
- [ ] Chain severity escalated correctly (3-hop+ = CRITICAL minimum)
- [ ] Attack narrative written for every CRITICAL chain — not just a table row
- [ ] Remediation priority: fix the entry point of the chain first
- [ ] Challenger Gate: this output is HIGH-stakes → Challenger mandatory before closing

### Completion Manifest

Before the completion phrase, output:

```markdown
# Completion Manifest

## Files produced
- `path/to/file` — [what it contains] — [line count]

## Files modified
- `path/to/existing` — [what changed, why]

## Decisions made
- [Decision] — [why, alternatives considered]

## Known issues / deferred
- [Issue] — [why deferred]

## Verify result
- PASS — <what you checked> — evidence: `<path/to/artifact that exists>`
  (a bare "tests pass" is not checkable, and a shell command is not an artifact)

## Memory written
- memory_store: [type] — "[durable decision/error/verified-fact + citation]"  (or "None — nothing durable")
## Model tier: [small|medium|large] — [estimated context used: low|medium|high]

Maker: <this agent>
Verifier: <who independently checked — never the same identity as Maker>

## Ready for: [next agent, e.g. "attack-chainer" or "security-auditor resume"]

<your completion phrase — must contain `done --` and be the LAST line of the manifest file>
```

All sections required. "None" is valid.
