# Security Auditor — OWASP Methodology

> Load this file only when running a full OWASP scan (--deep mode) or producing SECURITY_CONTROLS.md.
> For quick audits and bounded-task HANDOFFs, the shell in security-auditor.md is sufficient.
> Context cost: ~18k tokens. Only load when you have sufficient context budget remaining.

## How You Work

When invoked, follow this workflow in order:

### Phase 1: Understand the Target

Before starting, list numbered subtasks — one per OWASP category (A01-A10), plus Secret Scanning, Threat Modeling, and Cross-Module Pattern Analysis. Mark each DONE as you go. Print the list before proceeding.

- Read project docs (README, CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md) to understand the system
- Glob to map project structure — services, APIs, endpoints
- Read entry points (server.ts, main.rs, app.py) to understand architecture
- Identify the tech stack and **primary language** from package.json / Cargo.toml / requirements.txt / go.mod
- Map trust boundaries — where does user input enter? Where does data leave?
- Identify authentication and authorization flows
- Note the **framework** (Express, Fastify, Django, Spring, Rails, etc.) — used in Phase 1b

**Phase 1b: Fetch current security guidance for detected stack**
Use WebFetch or WebSearch to get up-to-date security guidance specific to the project's tech:
- Framework security hardening guide (e.g., "Express.js security best practices site:expressjs.com")
- Look up any CVEs for major dependencies found in package.json / requirements.txt
- Search for known vulnerabilities in the detected framework version if version is pinned
- Query: `"<framework> security checklist" OR "<framework> OWASP"` to get current expert guidance

Record the framework-specific checks you'll apply during the OWASP passes.
If web access is unavailable, note it and proceed with built-in knowledge.

### Expert Instinct: Follow the Thread
Real security experts don't just run checklists — they follow anomalies:
- If you find ONE missing auth check, investigate ALL similar endpoints
- If you find ONE hardcoded secret, search for ALL secrets project-wide
- If you find ONE injection point, check EVERY place user input enters the system
- If a mitigation exists in some places but not others, that's a systemic issue
- When something "feels wrong" (unusual pattern, inconsistency), dig deeper
- Ask: "If I were an attacker who just found this, what would I try next?"

### Phase 2: Automated Scanning (Semgrep + Dependency Audit)

Read `semgrep-guide.md` and `semgrep-community-rules.md` for full reference.

> **CRITICAL RULES — do not violate:**
> - **NEVER invoke `semgrep` directly.** Always use `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh`. The script handles pack probing, 404 detection, and community rule path resolution. Manual `semgrep` invocations bypass all of that.
> - **NEVER append `|| true` to scan commands.** If the scan command fails, you MUST investigate why. Silencing errors hides 404'd registry packs, YAML parse failures, and config errors — all of which produce 0-finding JSON that looks like "clean code" but is actually a broken scan.
> - **NEVER write ad-hoc Python or shell scripts to process scan results.** `scripts/semgrep-to-report-skeleton.py` already exists and is the correct tool. Writing a replacement from scratch wastes time and produces inferior output.
> - **NEVER manually compose `--config` flag lists.** `semgrep-full-audit.sh` probes each pack before adding it. If you bypass this and add a pack that returns a 404, you get 0 results with no error — a silent lie.

**Step 1: Preflight — tooling check**

Run these checks in order:
```
bash -c "which semgrep && semgrep --version" || echo "SEMGREP_NOT_INSTALLED"
bash -c "[ -d ~/.semgrep/rules/trailofbits ] && echo 'community-rules-cached' || echo 'community-rules-missing'"
bash -c "[ -f .semgrep/community-rules.lock ] && scripts/update-semgrep-rules.sh --verify || echo 'no-lock-file'"
bash -c "[ -d content/.semgrep/custom-rules ] && echo 'custom-rules-ok' || ([ -d .opencode/.semgrep/custom-rules ] && echo 'custom-rules-ok-project' || echo 'custom-rules-missing')"
```

If Semgrep is NOT installed, help the user install it (brew/pip/docker fallback). If they decline, proceed with grep-only mode and note the limitation in the report.

If community rules are missing, run `scripts/update-semgrep-rules.sh` to clone Trail of Bits, elttam, GitLab, and 0xdea sources to `~/.semgrep/rules/`. Without these you're only getting baseline coverage — missing the highest-signal rules.

> **Community rules canonical cache path:** `~/.semgrep/rules/{trailofbits,elttam,gitlab,0xdea}`. This is the path `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh` looks in. Always use `scripts/update-semgrep-rules.sh` to install rules — it clones to the canonical path. Do not clone rules anywhere else or the audit script won't find them.

If custom rules are missing (`custom-rules-missing`), the 98 gap-filler rules were not installed. Re-run `install.sh` (or `install.sh --project`) from the `attest` repo. The rules are stored in the user's personal OpenCode store — **not** inside the project being audited.

> **Custom rules personal store paths:**
> - **Global install:** `content/.semgrep/custom-rules/` — 5 language rulesets (Kotlin, Swift, Rust, PHP, C#)
> - **Global install:** `content/.semgrep/cpp-bridge-rules/` — C/C++ bridge security rules
> - **Project install:** `.opencode/.semgrep/custom-rules/` (inside the OpenCode project, not the audited repo)
>
> `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh` resolves these automatically relative to its own install location — you never need to pass the path manually. If the script reports `Custom: 0 language gap-filler ruleset(s) loaded`, the personal store is missing or empty.

If a `.semgrep/community-rules.lock` file exists and verify fails, STOP and surface to the user — someone bumped the community rules without updating the lock file. This is a reproducibility problem.

**Step 2: Detect project characteristics** (drives which rule packs to use)

```
bash -c "ls package.json go.mod Cargo.toml requirements.txt pyproject.toml pom.xml build.gradle build.gradle.kts Gemfile composer.json global.json build.sbt CMakeLists.txt Package.swift Podfile 2>/dev/null"
bash -c "find . -maxdepth 2 -name '*.csproj' -o -name '*.sln' -o -name '*.xcodeproj' -o -name '*.xcworkspace' 2>/dev/null | head -5"
```

Identify (polyglot — detect ALL languages present, not just the first):
- **Languages** — the audit script detects all of these automatically:
  - JS/TS: `package.json`, `*.ts`/`*.js`
  - Python: `requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`, `Pipfile`, `*.py`
  - Go: `go.mod`, `*.go`
  - Rust: `Cargo.toml`, `*.rs`
  - Java: `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `*.java`
  - Kotlin: `build.gradle.kts`, `*.kt`/`*.kts`
  - C# / .NET: `*.csproj`, `*.sln`, `global.json`, `*.cs`
  - C / C++: `CMakeLists.txt`, `Makefile`, `configure.ac`, `meson.build`, `*.c`/`*.cpp`/`*.h`
  - Swift / iOS: `Package.swift`, `*.xcodeproj`, `*.xcworkspace`, `Podfile`, `*.swift`
  - Ruby: `Gemfile`, `*.rb`
  - PHP: `composer.json`, `*.php`
  - Scala: `build.sbt`, `*.scala`
- **Framework** — grep `package.json` for express/next/react/vue/fastify; `requirements.txt` for django/flask/fastapi; `Gemfile` for rails; `go.mod` for gin/echo; `pom.xml`/`build.gradle` for spring
- **IaC present** — `Dockerfile*`, `*.tf`, `k8s/`, `kubernetes/`, `helm/`, `.github/workflows/`

> Write findings to files — local LLMs have no memory between sessions.
> Use: `write(filePath="docs/security/PROJECT_CHARACTERISTICS.md", content="...")` to persist what you detected.

**Step 3: Run the deep-audit scan**

Use the prebuilt audit runner — it composes the right rule pack list automatically:

```
bash scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh
```

The script:
- **Probes each registry pack** in isolation before adding it to the config list — 404'd or deprecated packs are logged and skipped rather than silently producing empty results
- **Auto-detects the community rules cache** (checks `$SEMGREP_COMMUNITY_CACHE`, then `~/.semgrep/rules/` (canonical), then `~/.cache/semgrep-community/` (legacy fallback))
- **Probes community rule directories** for YAML parse errors before including them (catches broken rule repos like `gitlab/typescript`)
- Includes: `p/owasp-top-ten`, `p/security-audit`, `p/secrets`, `p/default`, language pack, framework pack, language-native pack (e.g. `p/bandit` for Python, `p/gosec` for Go), IaC packs (if relevant), community rules (Trail of Bits, elttam, GitLab, 0xdea if C/C++), **custom gap-filler rules** (186 rules across 11 languages — loaded from the user's personal store at `content/.semgrep/custom-rules/` (global) or `.opencode/.semgrep/custom-rules/` (project install), auto-selected per detected language; covers JS/TS, Python, Go, Java, Ruby, C#, Kotlin, Rust, PHP, Swift, C++), project-specific rules from `.semgrep/project-rules/` inside the audited repo

Outputs:
- `docs/security/semgrep-results.json` — JSON findings
- `docs/security/semgrep-results.sarif` — SARIF for GitHub Security tab
- `docs/security/semgrep-scan-<timestamp>.log` — full scan log (includes which packs were probed, which were skipped, and why)

**Alternate scan modes (explicit opt-in):**
- `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh --fast` — Tier 1 scan only (CI tier, < 60s, high signal)
- `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh --baseline <commit>` — only new findings since commit
- `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh --offline` — use cached registry packs only (no network required)
- `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh --autofix-dryrun` — preview what autofix WOULD change (no files modified)
- `scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh --autofix` — apply autofix (LOW/WARNING only, HIGH/CRITICAL refused)

**Offline scanning:** If the environment has no internet (air-gapped, CI without egress), use `--offline`. Requires prior setup: `scripts/cache-registry-packs.sh` downloads all registry packs as local YAML files. Community rules must also be pre-cloned via `scripts/update-semgrep-rules.sh`. See `references/semgrep-guide.md` § Offline / Air-Gapped Scanning for details.

**Autofix rules:** Autofix is OPT-IN ONLY. Never run it by default. Even with `--autofix`, the script refuses to fix HIGH/CRITICAL — security fixes need human review. A flawed autofix for SQL injection could introduce a subtle bug. The script only autofixes WARNING/INFO severity findings: unused imports, deprecated API calls, missing types. If the user wants HIGH/CRITICAL auto-remediation, they must fix those manually after reviewing the finding.

**Step 4: Baseline check (for repeat audits)**

If `docs/security/LAST_AUDIT.json` exists, use the stored commit as the baseline:

```
bash -c '[ -f docs/security/LAST_AUDIT.json ] && LAST_COMMIT=$(jq -r .commit docs/security/LAST_AUDIT.json) && scripts/semgrep-full-audit.sh --baseline "$LAST_COMMIT"'
```

This surfaces only findings that appeared since the last audit — massively reduces noise on established codebases.

**Step 5: Parse results — VALIDATE before proceeding**

**Zero-results guard (MANDATORY):** Before doing anything else with the JSON, check the result count:
```
bash -c "jq '.results | length' docs/security/semgrep-results.json"
```

If the result count is **0**, do NOT proceed to report generation. Zero findings from a real codebase is almost always a sign of a broken scan, not a clean codebase. Investigate:
1. Read the scan log: `cat docs/security/semgrep-scan-*.log | tail -100`
2. Check which configs were actually loaded: look for `SKIPPED:` and `LOADED:` lines in the log
3. Check the errors array: `jq '.errors' docs/security/semgrep-results.json`
4. If all packs were skipped (all 404'd or errored), surface this to the user: "Scan completed with 0 findings but all/most packs were skipped due to errors. The scan result is unreliable. See the log for details."
5. Only proceed if you have confirmed that at least one pack was successfully loaded AND the codebase was actually scanned

Group by severity:
```
bash -c "jq '.results | group_by(.extra.severity) | map({severity: .[0].extra.severity, count: length})' docs/security/semgrep-results.json"
```

Group by OWASP category:
```
bash -c "jq '[.results[] | {owasp: (.extra.metadata.owasp[0] // \"Uncategorized\"), file: .path, line: .start.line, severity: .extra.severity, message: .extra.message}] | group_by(.owasp) | map({category: .[0].owasp, count: length, findings: .})' docs/security/semgrep-results.json"
```

**Step 6: Semgrep Finding Triage — False Positive Elimination (MANDATORY)**

Automated scanners are noisy. Before any finding enters the report, it must be verified
by a human (you). This step runs for EVERY finding in the Semgrep JSON — no exceptions.
A finding that isn't verified is not a finding.

**For each finding in `docs/security/semgrep-results.json`, execute this triage loop:**

```
jq -r '.results[] | "\(.check_id) | \(.path):\(.start.line) | \(.extra.severity) | \(.extra.message)"' \
  docs/security/semgrep-results.json
```

Process findings **one at a time**, severity-order (CRITICAL first):

**Triage Protocol per finding:**

1. **Read the flagged code** — not just the Semgrep snippet (1-3 lines), but the full context:
   ```
   read(filePath="<finding.path>", offset=<finding.start.line - 10>, limit=30)
   ```
   You need: what function is this in? What calls this function? What does the variable name suggest about its origin?

2. **Trace the tainted variable backwards to its source:**
   - What is the variable that Semgrep flagged? (e.g., `userInput` on line 42)
   - Where does it come from? (`req.body.name`, `req.params.id`, a database field, a config value, a hardcoded constant?)
   - Is it user-controlled? Can an external attacker set its value without authentication?

3. **Trace forward to the sink:**
   - Follow the variable from its source through any transforms (sanitization, validation, escaping, parameterization) to the sink Semgrep flagged
   - Did you find any sanitization step that neutralizes the threat?

4. **Check for upstream sanitization/validation middleware:**
   ```
   grep --pattern "sanitize|validate|escape|parameterize|prepared|encodeURI|htmlspecialchars|strip_tags" --recursive
   ```
   Is there a middleware or wrapper layer that processes all requests before they reach this code?

5. **Render a verdict:**

   | Verdict | Criteria | Action |
   |---------|----------|--------|
   | ✅ **REAL** | User-controlled input reaches the sink, no effective sanitization found | Include in report with full exploit chain |
   | ❌ **FALSE POSITIVE** | Input is not user-controlled, OR effective sanitization exists upstream, OR the flagged API is used safely in context | Document as FP with 1-sentence reason, exclude from report |
   | ⚠️ **UNVERIFIED** | Cannot trace the data flow definitively (e.g., input comes from a complex abstraction you can't fully resolve) | Include in report with UNVERIFIED label — developer must confirm |

6. **Record your verdict inline while processing** — do not batch verifications at the end.
   Write to `docs/security/triage-working.md` as you go:
   ```
   ## <rule_id> @ <file>:<line>
   Verdict: REAL / FALSE POSITIVE / UNVERIFIED
   Tainted variable: <name>
   Source: <where it comes from>
   Path to sink: <line N → line M → sink>
   Sanitization found: YES (describe) / NO
   Reason: <one sentence>
   ```

**Common false positive patterns to know:**

- **ORM parameterization mistaken for string concat**: `db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1', [userId])` — the `$1` looks like interpolation but is a parameterized query. REAL only if the variable is inside the query string itself, not in the params array.
- **User-controlled but not attacker-controlled**: a field from `req.user` (set by your auth middleware from a verified JWT) is "user" data but not attacker-controlled in most cases. Distinguish from `req.body` / `req.params`.
- **Sanitization in a shared util**: the rule flagged `innerHTML = value` but `value` was already run through `DOMPurify.sanitize()` three lines up. Read beyond the 1-line snippet.
- **Test/fixture files**: Semgrep sometimes flags hardcoded secrets in test files. If the path contains `test/`, `__tests__/`, `spec/`, `fixtures/`, or `mock`: it may be test data, not a real secret. Verify the value looks like actual credential material (length, entropy, format).
- **Framework auto-escaping**: Rails ERB (`<%= %>`) auto-escapes by default. Python's Jinja2 with `autoescape=True` auto-escapes. Flag is a FP unless the `safe` filter or `| safe` is used.

**Handling UNVERIFIED findings:**
- Include them in a separate section of the report: "Requires Developer Verification"
- Write the unresolved question explicitly: "Could not determine if `userId` on line 42 is always from the authenticated session or can be supplied by the request body"
- Provide the developer with the exact grep/test to resolve it

**After all findings are triaged:** count totals:
- REAL: N findings → these go in the main report
- FALSE POSITIVE: N findings → excluded (log the reasons)
- UNVERIFIED: N findings → go in the "Needs Developer Review" section

Print a triage summary before proceeding to Phase 3:
```
Semgrep Triage Summary:
  Total findings: N
  REAL:           N  → proceeding to OWASP passes and report
  FALSE POSITIVE: N  → excluded (reasons logged in docs/security/triage-working.md)
  UNVERIFIED:     N  → will appear in "Requires Developer Verification" section
```

Then write these totals back into the tracker so they survive context loss:
```
edit(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md",
  oldString="## Semgrep Triage Summary\n<!-- Filled in after Step 6 triage -->\nTotal Semgrep findings: ⏳\n  REAL:           ⏳\n  FALSE POSITIVE: ⏳\n  UNVERIFIED:     ⏳",
  newString="## Semgrep Triage Summary\nTotal Semgrep findings: <N>\n  REAL:           <N>  → in main report\n  FALSE POSITIVE: <N>  → excluded (see triage-working.md)\n  UNVERIFIED:     <N>  → in 'Requires Developer Verification' section\n  Triage file: docs/security/triage-working.md")
```

---

**Step 7: Check the triage file**

Read `docs/security/TRIAGE.md` (if it exists). For each finding in the scan, check whether it matches:
- **Fixed** → don't report (but warn if the finding still appears — the fix may have regressed)
- **False Positive** → downgrade to INFO with the triage justification
- **Accepted Risk** (unexpired) → downgrade to INFO with the owner and expiry
- **Accepted Risk** (expired) → bump BACK to original severity, flag for re-review

This prevents the same finding from being re-surfaced on every audit and keeps the signal-to-noise ratio high.

**Step 7: Run complementary tools**

Semgrep is one tool in the audit, not the whole audit. Run these alongside:

**Secrets (in addition to Semgrep's `p/secrets`):**
```
bash -c "command -v gitleaks && gitleaks detect --source . --report-format json --report-path docs/security/gitleaks.json --no-git 2>/dev/null || echo 'gitleaks not installed'"
bash -c "command -v gitleaks && gitleaks detect --source . --report-format json --report-path docs/security/gitleaks-history.json 2>/dev/null || echo 'skipping git history scan'"
```
- `gitleaks` with `--no-git` scans current code
- `gitleaks` without that flag scans git history — catches leaked secrets in old commits
- If gitleaks is not installed, suggest `brew install gitleaks` or `go install github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks/v8@latest`

**Dependency audit — osv-scanner (primary) + language-native (fallback):**
```
bash -c "command -v osv-scanner && osv-scanner --recursive . --format json -o docs/security/osv.json 2>/dev/null || echo 'osv-scanner not installed — falling back to language-native'"
# gate on BOTH the manifest and the tool; a failed audit must surface, not read clean (see TOOL_PREFLIGHT.md)
bash -c '[ -f package.json ] || exit 0; command -v npm >/dev/null || { echo "SKIPPED: npm not installed"; exit 0; }; npm audit --json > docs/security/npm-audit.json 2>/dev/null || echo "npm audit FAILED — investigate, not clean"'
bash -c '[ -f Cargo.toml ] || exit 0; command -v cargo-audit >/dev/null || { echo "SKIPPED: cargo-audit not installed"; exit 0; }; cargo audit --json > docs/security/cargo-audit.json 2>/dev/null || echo "cargo audit FAILED — investigate"'
bash -c '[ -f requirements.txt ] || exit 0; command -v pip-audit >/dev/null || { echo "SKIPPED: pip-audit not installed"; exit 0; }; pip-audit --format json > docs/security/pip-audit.json 2>/dev/null || echo "pip-audit FAILED — investigate"'
```

osv-scanner has the widest ecosystem coverage and freshest CVE data (uses OSV.dev). If it's not installed, suggest `brew install osv-scanner`. Fall back to language-native tools if needed.

**Container image scanning (if Dockerfile present):**
```
bash -c "[ -f Dockerfile ] && command -v trivy && trivy config Dockerfile --format json -o docs/security/trivy-dockerfile.json"
bash -c "[ -f Dockerfile ] && command -v hadolint && hadolint Dockerfile --format json > docs/security/hadolint.json"
```

Hadolint complements `p/dockerfile` — different coverage, both are worth running.

**SBOM (for compliance work):**
```
bash -c "command -v syft && syft packages . -o cyclonedx-json=docs/security/sbom.cdx.json 2>/dev/null"
```

Only run if SOC2/SLSA/supply-chain compliance is mentioned in the project's requirements. Don't waste time generating SBOMs for projects that don't need them.

**Step 8: Grep-based scanning (fills the gaps)**

Semgrep + community rules catch the vast majority of pattern-based findings. Grep is for cases Semgrep can't handle:
- Custom framework conventions not covered by any rule pack
- Multi-file patterns (Semgrep is per-file unless Pro)
- Project-specific naming conventions that aren't in custom rules yet

Use grep sparingly. If you find yourself reaching for grep, that's a signal you should WRITE A CUSTOM RULE for `.semgrep/project-rules/` so the next audit catches the pattern automatically.

Use the language detected in Step 2 to pick the right file type flag:
- TypeScript/JavaScript → `grep --type ts` or `--type js`
- Python → `--type py`
- Go → `--type go`
- Rust → `--type rust`
- Java → `--type java`

Read `owasp-checklist.md` for the systematic OWASP Top 10 checklist. Use `severity-matrix.md` for severity assessment.

**Step 9: Merge all findings**

Combine everything into the final report:
- Semgrep findings (JSON → report table, with rule ID, CWE, OWASP mapping)
- gitleaks findings (secrets)
- osv-scanner findings (dependency CVEs)
- trivy / hadolint findings (container/IaC)
- Manual review findings (logic flaws, design issues)

For every finding, verify against actual code before inclusion. Automated findings need human verification — the tool tells you WHERE to look, not whether it's real.

**Step 10: Save the audit checkpoint**

After the scan, update `docs/security/LAST_AUDIT.json` for next audit's baseline:

```
bash -c 'git rev-parse HEAD > /tmp/current-commit && jq -n --arg commit "$(cat /tmp/current-commit)" --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --argjson total $(jq ".results | length" docs/security/semgrep-results.json) "{commit: \$commit, timestamp: \$ts, findings_total: \$total}" > docs/security/LAST_AUDIT.json'
```

**Step 11: Write custom rules for new manual findings**

For each finding you identified manually (not caught by any rule pack), write a custom rule in `.semgrep/project-rules/` so the next audit catches it automatically. See `semgrep-guide.md` § Project-Specific Custom Rules for the format and test fixture requirement.

> Use `write(filePath=".semgrep/project-rules/<rule-name>.yaml", content="...")` to persist the rule.
> Also write a test fixture: `write(filePath=".semgrep/project-rules/tests/<rule-name>.test.<ext>", content="...")`.

This is the single most valuable thing you do in each audit — it makes the audit smarter over time.

### Phase 3: Plan the Audit + Initialize Tracker

- List the specific areas to audit based on the attack surface found in Phase 1
- Prioritize by risk: auth/input handling first, then data protection, then config
- State your audit plan before executing

**IMMEDIATELY after planning, create the OWASP tracker file on disk.**
This file is the single source of truth for audit progress. It is written before the
first pass begins and updated after every step of every pass. If the session is interrupted,
the tracker is how you resume without re-doing completed work.

**Initialize the tracker from the canonical template:**

```bash
# Read the OWASP tracker template, then write it to the project
write(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md", content=$(cat content/experts/templates/OWASP_TRACKER_template.md))
```

The template at `agents/templates/OWASP_TRACKER_template.md` contains all 10 OWASP categories (A01–A10), each with the standard structure: Pass log, Confidence score, Verdict. Plus the Semgrep Triage Summary, Pass Progress table, Attack Chain Analysis, and Final Gate sections. Do not invent your own structure — use the template verbatim and update it as the audit progresses.


> This file is your audit contract. Every row in the progress table must reach ✅ DONE
> before you write the final report. Do not rely on context memory — update this file.

### Phase 4: OWASP Deep Pass — 10 Dedicated Passes with Confidence Loop

**Resume check (run this first if returning to an in-progress audit):**
```
bash -c "[ -f docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md ] && echo 'TRACKER EXISTS — reading state' || echo 'TRACKER MISSING — start from scratch'"
```
If the tracker exists, read it to find which categories are already ✅ DONE or ⚠️ BLOCKED.
Skip DONE categories. Resume from the first non-DONE category.
Never re-run a DONE pass — it wastes time and produces duplicate findings in the report.

This is the core of the audit. Do NOT rush through these passes. You are the LLM — you
have the context, reasoning, and recall to catch things automated tools miss. Apply full
attention to each category. A quick pass that misses vulnerabilities is worse than a slow
pass that finds them.

**Golden rule for every pass:**
1. Check Semgrep's existing findings for this OWASP category — they are your starting leads
2. Read each flagged file:line in full context (10 lines before/after minimum)
3. Run the prescribed grep patterns — read EVERY match, not just the first
4. Answer each mandatory question with a YES/NO/PARTIAL and evidence from actual code
5. Score confidence 1-10 for this category
6. If score < 7: do a second focused pass targeting the weakest areas you identified
7. Repeat up to 3 passes per category — if still < 7 after 3 passes, surface the gap to the user
8. Record findings IN THE PASS before moving to the next — never batch at the end

**Per-pass confidence scoring:**
- **10** = read every relevant file, traced every data flow, high certainty
- **7–9** = solid coverage, minor edge cases possible
- **5–6** = partial — specific areas not covered, re-pass required
- **< 5** = surface-level only → **STOP, surface gap to user, do not proceed**

Do not skip any category even if you believe it's not applicable — document WHY
it's not applicable with specific evidence (e.g., "A10 SSRF: codebase makes no
outbound HTTP calls — confirmed by grep with 0 matches on `fetch|axios|http.get`").

---

**Pass 1 — A01: Broken Access Control**

*Adapt `--type ts` to your detected language throughout all passes.*

**Mandatory questions — answer each with YES/NO/PARTIAL + evidence:**
1. Does every HTTP route have an auth check applied BEFORE the handler executes?
2. Do any queries fetch a resource by ID without filtering by the current user's ownership (IDOR)?
3. Are admin/privileged functions gated by role checks, not just hidden in the UI?
4. Can a lower-privilege user call higher-privilege endpoints by crafting a direct request?
5. Are access control checks duplicated at the API layer (not just the UI layer)?

**Step 1 — Map all routes:**
```
grep --pattern "router\.(get|post|put|patch|delete|use)|app\.(get|post|put|patch|delete|use)|@(Get|Post|Put|Patch|Delete|RequestMapping)" --recursive
```
Read each route file. For each route: identify the middleware chain — is auth applied first?

**Step 2 — Find IDOR candidates:**
```
grep --pattern "findById|findOne|getById|findByPk|find_by_id|\.find\(|WHERE id\s*=" --recursive
```
For each match: read the surrounding 15 lines. Does the query filter by `userId`, `ownerId`, or `req.user.id`? If not, it's an IDOR candidate.

**Step 3 — Find role/permission checks:**
```
grep --pattern "isAdmin|role\s*===|hasPermission|requireRole|@PreAuthorize|@login_required|authorize\(" --recursive
```
Read every file that contains user data mutations — are role checks present?

**Step 4 — Framework-specific verification:**
- Express: look for `router.use(authMiddleware)` BEFORE route definitions, not after
- Django: look for `@login_required` and `@permission_required` on every view
- Spring: look for `@PreAuthorize` or security config `antMatchers`
- FastAPI: look for `Depends(get_current_user)` in every protected route signature
- Rails: look for `before_action :authenticate_user!`

**Step 5 — Horizontal privilege escalation test:**
Pick 2-3 routes that return user-owned data. Trace: can user A access user B's data
by simply changing an ID in the request? Read the query and verify the WHERE clause.

Record findings for A01. Score confidence (1-10). If < 7, re-pass targeting uncovered routes.

**After scoring — update the tracker (MANDATORY before starting A02):**
```
edit(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md",
  oldString="| A01 | Broken Access Control        | ⏳ PENDING  | 0      | —          | —        |",
  newString="| A01 | Broken Access Control        | <STATUS>   | <N>    | <SCORE>/10 | <COUNT> findings |")
```
Then update the A01 detail section:
- Fill in the mandatory question checkboxes (✅ YES / ❌ NO / ⚠️ PARTIAL — evidence)
- Fill in the Grep runs table (pattern, match count, files read, notes)
- Fill in Files read list
- Fill in Semgrep findings and Manual findings
- Add a Pass log entry: `Pass <N> — <timestamp> — confidence <X>/10 — <one-sentence summary>`
- Set Confidence score and Verdict

If confidence < 7: set Status to `🔄 RE-PASS <N>` and continue the pass before A02.
If confidence ≥ 7: set Status to `✅ DONE` and move to A02.
If confidence < 5 after 3 passes: set Status to `⚠️ BLOCKED` — stop and surface to user.

**Pass 2 — A02: Cryptographic Failures**

**Mandatory questions:**
1. Are any passwords or secrets stored in plaintext or with weak hashes (MD5, SHA1, SHA256 without salt)?
2. Is sensitive data (PII, payment data, tokens) encrypted at rest in the database?
3. Is TLS enforced for all external communication — no fallback to HTTP?
4. Are cryptographic keys and secrets stored in environment variables (not hardcoded)?
5. Are any custom crypto implementations present (always a red flag)?

**Step 1 — Find hash/crypto usage:**
```
grep --pattern "md5|sha1|sha256|createHash|hashlib\.(md5|sha1)|MessageDigest|DigestUtils|crypto\." --recursive
```
Read every match. For password storage: only bcrypt, argon2, scrypt, or PBKDF2 are acceptable.
MD5/SHA1/SHA256 for passwords = CRITICAL finding.

**Step 2 — Find hardcoded secrets:**
```
grep --pattern "(password|secret|api_key|apikey|token|private_key)\s*=\s*['\"][^'\"]{8,}" --recursive
grep --pattern "-----BEGIN (RSA |EC |OPENSSH |)PRIVATE KEY" --recursive
```
Read each match — is this a real secret or a variable name/placeholder?

**Step 3 — Find TLS configuration:**
```
grep --pattern "rejectUnauthorized|verify\s*=\s*False|ssl_verify|CURL_SSL_VERIFYPEER|InsecureSkipVerify|checkServerIdentity" --recursive
```
Any `rejectUnauthorized: false`, `verify=False`, or `InsecureSkipVerify: true` = HIGH/CRITICAL.

**Step 4 — Check .env and config files:**
Read `.env`, `.env.example`, `config/`, `settings.py`, `application.properties`, `appsettings.json`.
Are real secrets present? Are defaults obviously weak?

**Step 5 — Find custom crypto:**
```
grep --pattern "XOR|bit_xor|rol\b|ror\b|custom.*cipher|encode.*decode|obfuscat" --recursive
```
Any custom crypto = immediate HIGH finding regardless of intent.

Record findings for A02. Score confidence (1-10). If < 7, re-pass targeting database field encryption and transport config.

**After scoring — update the tracker (MANDATORY before starting A03):**
```
edit(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md",
  oldString="| A02 | Cryptographic Failures       | ⏳ PENDING  | 0      | —          | —        |",
  newString="| A02 | Cryptographic Failures       | <STATUS>   | <N>    | <SCORE>/10 | <COUNT> findings |")
```
Update the A02 detail section: mandatory Q answers, grep runs table, files read, findings, pass log entry.
If < 7 after pass 1-2: status `🔄 RE-PASS <N>`. If ≥ 7: `✅ DONE`. If < 5 after 3: `⚠️ BLOCKED`.

---

**Pass 3 — A03: Injection**

*This is the highest-value pass — read every single match carefully.*

**Mandatory questions:**
1. Are ALL database queries parameterized or using an ORM with no raw string concatenation?
2. Is user input ever passed to shell commands, system calls, or subprocess?
3. Is user input ever rendered into HTML without escaping?
4. Can user input traverse file paths to access unintended files?
5. Is user input ever used in template engines without auto-escaping?

**Step 1 — SQL injection:**
```
grep --pattern "query\s*\(.*\$\{|execute\s*\(.*\+|\.raw\s*\(|db\.query\s*\(.*req\.|WHERE.*\+" --recursive
grep --pattern "f\"SELECT|f'SELECT|f\"INSERT|f\"UPDATE|f\"DELETE|%s.*%.*sql|format.*SELECT" --recursive
```
For each match: read 20 lines of context. Is the interpolated value user-controlled?
Trace: where does the variable come from? `req.params`, `req.body`, `request.GET`?

**Step 2 — Command injection:**
```
grep --pattern "exec\s*\(|execSync\s*\(|spawn\s*\(|spawnSync\s*\(|subprocess\.(call|run|Popen)|os\.system|shell_exec|passthru|popen" --recursive
```
For each match: is any argument derived from user input? Even indirect — e.g., a filename
from a form field used in a shell command.

**Step 3 — XSS:**
```
grep --pattern "innerHTML\s*=|dangerouslySetInnerHTML|document\.write\s*\(|\.html\s*\(|v-html\s*=|render_template_string|mark_safe|\.unescape|sanitize\s*=\s*false" --recursive
```
For each match: is the value from user input, a database field, or URL parameters?
Even database fields can carry stored XSS if not sanitized on write.

**Step 4 — Path traversal:**
```
grep --pattern "readFile\s*\(.*req\.|createReadStream\s*\(.*req\.|path\.join\s*\(.*req\.|open\s*\(.*request\.|File\s*\(.*request\." --recursive
```
For each match: is the path component user-controlled? Is there a sanitization step that
strips `../` sequences?

**Step 5 — Template injection:**
```
grep --pattern "render_template_string\s*\(|Template\s*\(.*format\s*\(|\.render\s*\(.*user|Jinja2|nunjucks\.renderString|ejs\.render\s*\(.*req\." --recursive
```
Template injection is often overlooked. User-controlled template strings = RCE.

Record findings for A03. Score confidence (1-10). **This is the category most likely to miss
sub-variants — if score < 8, re-pass targeting ORM edge cases (raw queries, query builders
with `literal()` or `unsafe()` methods) and stored XSS paths through the database.**

**After scoring — update the tracker (MANDATORY before starting A04):**
```
edit(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md",
  oldString="| A03 | Injection                    | ⏳ PENDING  | 0      | —          | —        |",
  newString="| A03 | Injection                    | <STATUS>   | <N>    | <SCORE>/10 | <COUNT> findings |")
```
Update the A03 detail section: mandatory Q answers, grep runs table (one row per pattern — SQL, command, XSS, path, template), files read, findings, pass log entry.
If < 8 after pass 1: status `🔄 RE-PASS <N>`. If ≥ 8: `✅ DONE`. If < 5 after 3: `⚠️ BLOCKED`.

---

**Pass 4 — A04: Insecure Design**

**Mandatory questions:**
1. Are rate limits applied to authentication endpoints (login, password reset, OTP)?
2. Is there brute-force protection (account lockout after N failed attempts)?
3. Are business logic flows tamper-resistant (e.g., can a user skip steps in a payment flow)?
4. Is there server-side validation for all operations — not just client-side?
5. Can the same operation be triggered multiple times to exploit race conditions?

**Step 1 — Rate limiting:**
```
grep --pattern "rateLimit|rate_limit|throttle|RateLimiter|slowDown|express-rate-limit|django-ratelimit|rack-attack|golang.org/x/time/rate" --recursive
```
If no rate limiter found: where are login, password reset, and OTP endpoints defined?
Read those handlers — is there ANY protection against brute force?

**Step 2 — Account lockout:**
```
grep --pattern "failedAttempt|loginAttempt|lockout|maxAttempt|failCount|locked_until|lockUntil" --recursive
```
No account lockout on auth endpoints = MEDIUM finding (OWASP A07 overlap).

**Step 3 — Business logic validation:**
Read the most sensitive business operations (payment, account creation, privilege change).
Can a user skip a step by sending a direct API request? Is sequence enforced server-side?

**Step 4 — Race conditions:**
```
grep --pattern "check.*then.*use|read.*then.*write|SELECT.*UPDATE|findOne.*then.*save" --recursive
```
Look for time-of-check/time-of-use (TOCTOU) patterns. Are critical operations atomic or
wrapped in transactions?

**Step 5 — Server-side validation:**
Find all places where user input enters. Is there server-side validation in addition
to any client-side checks? Grep for validation libraries and check which routes use them.

Record findings for A04. Score confidence (1-10). If < 7, re-pass focusing on business-critical flows.

**After scoring — update the tracker (MANDATORY before starting A05):**
```
edit(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md",
  oldString="| A04 | Insecure Design              | ⏳ PENDING  | 0      | —          | —        |",
  newString="| A04 | Insecure Design              | <STATUS>   | <N>    | <SCORE>/10 | <COUNT> findings |")
```
Update the A04 detail section: mandatory Q answers, grep runs table, files read, findings, pass log entry.
If < 7: `🔄 RE-PASS`. If ≥ 7: `✅ DONE`. If < 5 after 3: `⚠️ BLOCKED`.

---

**Pass 5 — A05: Security Misconfiguration**

**Mandatory questions:**
1. Are CORS policies restrictive — not `*` or open to untrusted origins?
2. Are security headers present (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options)?
3. Do error responses leak stack traces, SQL errors, or internal paths in production?
4. Are debug modes, verbose logging, or development features disabled in production?
5. Are default credentials, accounts, or keys changed from vendor defaults?

**Step 1 — CORS:**
```
grep --pattern "cors\s*\(|Access-Control-Allow-Origin|origin:\s*['\"]?\*|allowedOrigins|CORS_ORIGIN" --recursive
```
Read every CORS config. `origin: '*'` or `origin: true` on a credentialed endpoint = CRITICAL.
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` = exploitable.

**Step 2 — Security headers:**
```
grep --pattern "helmet\s*\(|x-frame-options|x-content-type|strict-transport|content-security-policy|referrer-policy|permissions-policy" --recursive --caseInsensitive
```
If no `helmet` or equivalent: read the main server setup file — are headers set manually?
Missing HSTS on HTTPS service = MEDIUM. Missing CSP = MEDIUM.

**Step 3 — Error handling / information disclosure:**
```
grep --pattern "stack\s*:.*err\.stack|err\.message|error\.toString|console\.error.*err|send\s*\(err\)|res\.json\s*\(err|response\s*\(.*exception" --recursive
```
Read each match — is the raw error/stack sent to the client? In production, only generic
error messages should reach the user. Internal paths, SQL errors, stack traces = HIGH.

**Step 4 — Debug/dev mode in production configs:**
```
grep --pattern "DEBUG\s*=\s*True|debug\s*:\s*true|NODE_ENV.*development|verbose\s*:\s*true|FLASK_DEBUG|APP_DEBUG" --recursive
```
Read every config and .env.example — what are the defaults? If `DEBUG=True` is the default,
that's a deployment risk.

**Step 5 — Check Dockerfile and compose for misconfig:**
Read `Dockerfile*`, `docker-compose*.yml`. Look for: running as root, hardcoded secrets in
ENV instructions, exposed ports that shouldn't be public, missing health checks.

Record findings for A05. Score confidence (1-10). If < 7, re-pass targeting the server/app startup file.

**After scoring — update the tracker (MANDATORY before starting A06):**
```
edit(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md",
  oldString="| A05 | Security Misconfiguration    | ⏳ PENDING  | 0      | —          | —        |",
  newString="| A05 | Security Misconfiguration    | <STATUS>   | <N>    | <SCORE>/10 | <COUNT> findings |")
```
Update the A05 detail section: mandatory Q answers, grep runs table, files read, findings, pass log entry.
If < 7: `🔄 RE-PASS`. If ≥ 7: `✅ DONE`. If < 5 after 3: `⚠️ BLOCKED`.

---

**Pass 6 — A06: Vulnerable and Outdated Components**

**Mandatory questions:**
1. Are there known CVEs in the current dependency versions?
2. Are any dependencies severely outdated (major version behind)?
3. Are dependencies pinned to exact versions or floating ranges?
4. Are there unmaintained dependencies (no releases in > 18 months)?

**Step 1 — Read the dependency manifest:**
Read `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `Cargo.toml`, `pom.xml`, `Gemfile`, `go.mod`.
Note the pinning strategy — exact versions vs. ranges (`^`, `~`, `>=`).

**Step 2 — Parse scan results from Phase 2:**
Read `docs/security/osv.json` (or `npm-audit.json`, `pip-audit.json`).
For each CVE: read the advisory and assess exploitability in THIS codebase's usage pattern.
A CVE in a dep you use for logging that requires a different vulnerable code path = lower risk.

**Step 3 — Check for obviously dangerous versions:**
```
grep --pattern "\"lodash\":|\"moment\":|\"request\":|\"node-serialize\":|\"serialize-javascript\":|log4j|struts|spring-core" --recursive
```
These are historically high-CVE packages. Even if no CVE found, note if dramatically outdated.

**Step 4 — Assess maintenance status:**
For the top 5-10 critical dependencies (auth, crypto, framework): when was the last release?
Flag any that haven't had a release in > 18 months.

Record findings for A06. Note: many CVE findings will be CONFIRMED real or FALSE POSITIVE
only after verifying how the package feature is actually used in this codebase.
Score confidence (1-10). If < 7, re-pass cross-referencing CVE descriptions with usage patterns.

**After scoring — update the tracker (MANDATORY before starting A07):**
```
edit(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md",
  oldString="| A06 | Vulnerable Components        | ⏳ PENDING  | 0      | —          | —        |",
  newString="| A06 | Vulnerable Components        | <STATUS>   | <N>    | <SCORE>/10 | <COUNT> findings |")
```
Update the A06 detail section: mandatory Q answers, dependency manifest read, CVEs assessed, maintenance flags, pass log entry.
If < 7: `🔄 RE-PASS`. If ≥ 7: `✅ DONE`. If < 5 after 3: `⚠️ BLOCKED`.

---

**Pass 7 — A07: Identification and Authentication Failures**

**Mandatory questions:**
1. Are passwords hashed with bcrypt/argon2/scrypt (not MD5/SHA1 or base64)?
2. Are JWTs validated for algorithm (reject `alg: none`), signature, and expiration?
3. Are session tokens httpOnly, Secure, and SameSite=Strict/Lax?
4. Are there protections against credential stuffing on login (rate limiting, CAPTCHA)?
5. Is there a secure password reset flow (time-limited tokens, not security questions)?

**Step 1 — Password hashing:**
```
grep --pattern "bcrypt|argon2|scrypt|pbkdf2|hashpw|check_password|make_password|password_hash|PasswordHasher" --recursive
```
If no strong hashing found: search for where users are created and passwords stored.
Read the exact code. `sha256(password)` without salt = CRITICAL.

**Step 2 — JWT validation:**
```
grep --pattern "jwt\.verify|jwt\.decode|jsonwebtoken|PyJWT|jose|jwtDecode|verify_jwt" --recursive
```
Read every JWT decode/verify call:
- Is `algorithms` specified and does it exclude `none`?
- Is the expiration (`exp`) checked?
- Is the signature actually verified (not just decoded without verification)?
- Is the secret/public key loaded from env, not hardcoded?

**Step 3 — Session / cookie security:**
```
grep --pattern "httpOnly|secure\s*:|sameSite|cookieOptions|session\s*\(|cookie\s*\(" --recursive
```
Read every cookie/session configuration. Missing `httpOnly: true` = HIGH.
Missing `secure: true` (sent over HTTP) = HIGH on any HTTPS service.
`sameSite: 'none'` without `secure: true` = HIGH.

**Step 4 — Password reset flow:**
Find the password reset endpoint. Read the full handler:
- Is the token cryptographically random (not a sequential ID or timestamp)?
- Is the token time-limited (expiry checked on use)?
- Is the token single-use (invalidated after successful reset)?
- Can an attacker enumerate valid email addresses from error messages?

**Step 5 — Multi-factor:**
```
grep --pattern "totp|otp|2fa|mfa|two.factor|speakeasy|authenticator|google-auth" --recursive
```
Note whether MFA is available and whether it can be bypassed by API calls.

Record findings for A07. Score confidence (1-10). This is the second most common critical
finding source — if < 8, re-pass on the full auth module.

**After scoring — update the tracker (MANDATORY before starting A08):**
```
edit(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md",
  oldString="| A07 | Authentication Failures      | ⏳ PENDING  | 0      | —          | —        |",
  newString="| A07 | Authentication Failures      | <STATUS>   | <N>    | <SCORE>/10 | <COUNT> findings |")
```
Update the A07 detail section: mandatory Q answers, grep runs table, files read (auth handlers, session config, password reset flow), findings, pass log entry.
If < 8 after pass 1: `🔄 RE-PASS`. If ≥ 8: `✅ DONE`. If < 5 after 3: `⚠️ BLOCKED`.

---

**Pass 8 — A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures**

**Mandatory questions:**
1. Are CI/CD pipeline configs protected against unauthorized modification?
2. Are packages installed from verified sources with integrity checks?
3. Is deserialization of untrusted data guarded?
4. Are software updates signed and verified before applying?

**Step 1 — Deserialization:**
```
grep --pattern "pickle\.loads|pickle\.load|yaml\.load\s*\((?!.*Loader)|unserialize|ObjectInputStream|readObject|JSON\.parse.*req\.|eval\s*\(.*req\.|Function\s*\(.*req\." --recursive
```
`pickle.loads(user_data)` = CRITICAL. `yaml.load()` without `Loader=yaml.SafeLoader` = HIGH.
`eval(req.body.code)` = CRITICAL. Read each match carefully.

**Step 2 — CI/CD integrity:**
Read `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `.gitlab-ci.yml`, `Jenkinsfile`, `.circleci/config.yml`.
Look for: are action versions pinned to SHA hashes (not floating `@v3`)? Are secrets
referenced as `${{ secrets.X }}` or hardcoded? Are there `curl | bash` patterns?

**Step 3 — Subresource integrity:**
```
grep --pattern "<script.*src=|<link.*href=" --recursive
```
If loading external scripts/styles: is `integrity=` attribute present?
Missing SRI on CDN-hosted scripts = MEDIUM.

**Step 4 — Package integrity:**
Is there a `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `Cargo.lock`, `poetry.lock`?
Are lockfiles committed to the repo? Missing lockfile = developers may get different
versions than what was tested.

Record findings for A08. Score confidence (1-10). If < 7, re-pass on CI/CD configs.

**After scoring — update the tracker (MANDATORY before starting A09):**
```
edit(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md",
  oldString="| A08 | Data Integrity Failures      | ⏳ PENDING  | 0      | —          | —        |",
  newString="| A08 | Data Integrity Failures      | <STATUS>   | <N>    | <SCORE>/10 | <COUNT> findings |")
```
Update the A08 detail section: mandatory Q answers, deserialization grep results, CI/CD file review, SRI and lockfile checks, findings, pass log entry.
If < 7: `🔄 RE-PASS`. If ≥ 7: `✅ DONE`. If < 5 after 3: `⚠️ BLOCKED`.

---

**Pass 9 — A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**

**Mandatory questions:**
1. Are authentication events logged (successful login, failed login, logout)?
2. Are authorization failures logged (access denied, forbidden)?
3. Are logs sanitized against log injection (CRLF, ANSI escape codes)?
4. Are logs stored somewhere they can't be deleted by a compromised app user?
5. Are there monitoring/alerting hooks for suspicious activity?

**Step 1 — Find the logging setup:**
```
grep --pattern "winston|pino|bunyan|morgan|log4j|logback|logging\.getLogger|structlog|zerolog|slog\." --recursive
```
Read the logger configuration file. What log level is used in production? Is PII
redacted before logging?

**Step 2 — Auth event logging:**
Find login, logout, and auth failure handlers. Read them:
```
grep --pattern "login\s*\(|signIn\s*\(|authenticate\s*\(|failed.*login|login.*failed|unauthorized|forbidden|401|403" --recursive
```
Are these events logged with: timestamp, user ID (not password), IP address, user-agent?
No logging of failed auth attempts = MEDIUM finding.

**Step 3 — Log injection:**
```
grep --pattern "log\.(info|warn|error|debug)\s*\(.*req\.|logger\.(info|warn|error)\s*\(.*user\.|log\.\(.*body\." --recursive
```
If user-controlled data is logged without sanitization, attackers can inject false log
entries by including `\n`, `\r`, or ANSI escape sequences in inputs.

**Step 4 — Sensitive data in logs:**
```
grep --pattern "log.*password|log.*token|log.*secret|log.*credit|log.*ssn|log.*dob" --recursive --caseInsensitive
```
Any logging of passwords, tokens, or PII = CRITICAL if in plain text.

**Step 5 — Monitoring hooks:**
Is there a SIEM integration, alerting system, or at minimum a way to detect brute-force
in the logs? Read the README/ops docs. Note absence of monitoring as a MEDIUM finding.

Record findings for A09. Score confidence (1-10). If < 7, re-pass on the auth module logging.

**After scoring — update the tracker (MANDATORY before starting A10):**
```

  newString="| A09 | Logging & Monitoring         | <STATUS>   | <N>    | <SCORE>/10 | <COUNT> findings |")
```
Update the A09 detail section: mandatory Q answers, logger config read, auth event logging check, log injection grep, sensitive data grep, findings, pass log entry.
If < 7: `🔄 RE-PASS`. If ≥ 7: `✅ DONE`. If < 5 after 3: `⚠️ BLOCKED`.

---

**Pass 10 — A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**

**Mandatory questions:**
1. Does the application make outbound HTTP requests to URLs derived from user input?
2. Are there allowlists restricting which hosts/IPs the application can reach?
3. Can an attacker use SSRF to reach internal services (metadata APIs, databases, admin panels)?
4. Are redirects followed, and can they be abused to reach internal addresses?
5. Are there webhook or URL-preview features that make outbound requests?

**Step 1 — Find all outbound HTTP calls:**
```
grep --pattern "fetch\s*\(|axios\.(get|post|put|delete|request)|http\.(get|request)|https\.(get|request)|request\s*\(|urllib\.request|requests\.(get|post)|http\.NewRequest|http\.Get\s*\(" --recursive
```
Read EVERY match. For each outbound request: trace the URL variable backwards. Does it
originate from user input (request body, query param, header, database field)?

**Step 2 — Webhook and URL-preview features:**
```
grep --pattern "webhook|callback.*url|callbackUrl|redirectUrl|redirect_url|returnUrl|return_url|imageUrl|image_url|preview.*url|url.*preview" --recursive
```
These are the highest-risk SSRF sources. Read every handler that accepts a URL parameter.
Is the URL validated against an allowlist before the request is made?

**Step 3 — Internal metadata API access:**
If the app runs in AWS/GCP/Azure: can an attacker use SSRF to reach
`169.254.169.254` (AWS IMDS), `metadata.google.internal`, or `metadata.azure.com`?
These expose IAM credentials if reached.

**Step 4 — DNS rebinding and allowlist bypass:**
If there IS a hostname allowlist: is it checked AFTER DNS resolution?
A hostname can resolve to `127.0.0.1` after passing an allowlist check (DNS rebinding).
Look for post-resolution IP validation.

**Step 5 — Redirect following:**
```
grep --pattern "maxRedirects|followRedirects|follow_redirects|redirect.*follow|allow_redirects" --recursive
```
If redirects are followed without validation: an attacker can chain an external SSRF to
reach internal services via a redirect chain.

Record findings for A10. Score confidence (1-10). If < 7, re-pass reading every URL-accepting parameter.

**After scoring — update the tracker (MANDATORY before the confidence summary):**

Any category still showing `⏳ PENDING` means the tracker was not updated — go back and update it now.

Any category showing `⚠️ BLOCKED` (confidence < 5 after 3 passes): STOP and surface the gap to the user with:
- The specific question you could not answer
- Which files you'd need to read to answer it
- What additional context would let you complete the pass

Any category scoring < 7 that is NOT yet `⚠️ BLOCKED`: run one more pass, then update the tracker.

Do NOT write the final report until all categories score ≥ 7 and the tracker shows no `⏳ PENDING` rows.

### Phase 4a: Secret Scanning
- API keys, tokens, passwords in source code
- .env files committed to git
- Private keys, certificates in the repo
- Hardcoded connection strings with credentials
- Grep patterns: `Grep -i "password.*=.*['\"]|api_key.*=.*['\"]|secret.*=.*['\"]"`, `Grep -i "BEGIN.*PRIVATE|BEGIN.*RSA|BEGIN.*CERTIFICATE"`
- Check `.gitignore` for proper exclusions

### Phase 4b: Threat Modeling (STRIDE per Component)

Threat modeling is NOT a checklist — it's a systematic per-component analysis.

#### Step 1: Draw the Data Flow Diagram (DFD)
Using Mermaid, create a DFD that shows:
- External entities (users, third-party APIs, browsers)
- Processes (API server, auth service, background workers)
- Data stores (database, cache, file system, secrets)
- Data flows between them (with protocol: HTTPS, gRPC, SQL, etc.)
- Trust boundaries (where privilege level changes)

Write this to `docs/security/THREAT_MODEL_DFD.md`.

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Trust Boundary: Internet"
        User["fa:fa-user User/Browser"]
        ExtAPI[External API]
    end
    subgraph "Trust Boundary: DMZ"
        LB[Load Balancer]
        WAF[WAF]
    end
    subgraph "Trust Boundary: Internal Network"
        API[API Server]
        Auth[Auth Service]
        Worker[Background Worker]
    end
    subgraph "Trust Boundary: Data Layer"
        DB[(Database)]
        Cache[(Redis Cache)]
        FileStore[(File Storage)]
    end
    User -->|HTTPS| LB
    LB --> API
    API -->|Internal| Auth
    API -->|SQL/TLS| DB
    API -->|Redis Protocol| Cache
    Worker -->|SQL| DB
    ExtAPI -->|HTTPS| API
```

#### Step 2: STRIDE per Component
For EACH component in the DFD, systematically apply ALL 6 STRIDE categories:

| Component | Spoofing | Tampering | Repudiation | Info Disclosure | DoS | Elevation |
|-----------|----------|-----------|-------------|-----------------|-----|-----------|
| API Server | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] |
| Auth Service | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] |
| Database | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] | [threat] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

For each cell, ask:
- **Spoofing**: Can this component's identity be faked? Can someone pretend to be this?
- **Tampering**: Can data entering/leaving/stored in this component be modified?
- **Repudiation**: Can actions on this component be denied? Is there an audit trail?
- **Information Disclosure**: Can this component leak sensitive data? Error messages? Logs? Side channels?
- **Denial of Service**: Can this component be overwhelmed? Resource exhaustion? Deadlocks?
- **Elevation of Privilege**: Can a user of this component gain higher permissions?

#### Step 2b: Standing Threat Archetypes — Bootstrap & Authority (MANDATORY)

In addition to the per-component STRIDE pass, explicitly assess these three named archetypes against the design for EVERY threat model. All three are Elevation-of-Privilege variants that field-testing (M29 field lessons) found slip through per-component STRIDE passes because they are cross-cutting (about the system's t=0 state, not any one component):

1. **bootstrap-authority** — the system has no way to create the first privileged user without out-of-band intervention (a hand-run SQL INSERT, a seed script that isn't safe to re-run, or an undocumented env var). Ask: on a brand-new, empty database, how does the first admin/owner come to exist?
2. **self-referential-permission-gate** — a permission check is gated on a role that only that same role (or a role reachable only through it) can grant. Concretely: "only an admin may grant the admin role" with no other path to create the first admin is a circular authority trap with no escape path. Ask: for every "only role X may grant role Y" rule, is there a path to grant Y that does NOT require already holding X or Y?
3. **rbac-highest-role-wins** — a many-to-many (N roles per principal) role schema whose enforcement resolves effective permissions by picking "the highest-priority role" instead of computing the **union of grants** across all roles the principal holds. This can silently under-grant a permission legitimately held via a lower-priority role, or over-grant depending on the implementation. Ask: if a principal can hold more than one role, does the enforcement code union the grants, or does it short-circuit on the first/highest-priority match?

For each archetype: rate it (DREAD, same as any other threat) if applicable, or record it as explicitly assessed and ruled N/A (e.g. single-role systems have no rbac-highest-role-wins exposure) — never silently omit it. Mitigations for (1) and (2) both resolve to the same requirement: a documented, idempotent bootstrap mechanism (seed script safe to re-run, first-user-is-admin logic, CLI bootstrap command, or invite-token flow) that requires **no manual SQL**. `validate-security-controls.sh` enforces that `docs/SECURITY_CONTROLS.md` documents concrete, non-placeholder answers for all three (see `agents/security-auditor.md` § Bootstrap & Empty-State Checklist / Threat Catalog / RBAC Cardinality Rule).

#### Step 3: Rate Each Threat
For each threat identified, rate using DREAD:
- **D**amage potential (1-10)
- **R**eproducibility (1-10)
- **E**xploitability (1-10)
- **A**ffected users (1-10)
- **D**iscoverability (1-10)
- DREAD score = average of all 5

Priority: DREAD >= 8 = CRITICAL, 6-7 = HIGH, 4-5 = MEDIUM, 1-3 = LOW

#### Step 4: Map Threats to Mitigations
For each threat with DREAD >= 4:
1. Identify existing mitigations (what's already in the code?)
2. Identify gaps (what's missing?)
3. Recommend specific controls with code examples
4. Map to: OWASP category, CWE number, specific file:line

#### Step 5: Write Threat Model Document
Write the complete threat model to `docs/security/THREAT_MODEL.md`:
- DFD (Mermaid)
- Trust boundaries
- STRIDE per component table
- DREAD-rated threat list
- Mitigation mapping
- Residual risk (threats accepted without mitigation + justification)

#### Threat Modeling Loop
After completing Steps 1-5:
1. Review the DFD — did you miss any components or data flows?
2. Review the STRIDE table — are any cells empty that shouldn't be?
3. For each CRITICAL/HIGH threat, verify the mitigation exists in actual code
4. If you find gaps, add them and re-rate
5. Continue until you're confident the model is complete (confidence >= 8)

### Phase 4c: Cross-Module Pattern Analysis

After individual findings, perform pattern analysis as a loop:
1. Group ALL findings collected so far by root cause (e.g., all auth failures from missing middleware)
2. Count occurrences — same pattern in 3+ places = architectural issue
3. For patterns appearing 3+ times, recommend:
   - **Architectural fix** (shared middleware, validation layer) not individual patches
   - Example: "Missing input validation in 8 endpoints -> Create shared validation middleware"
4. Loop through all findings until every one is categorized under a root cause
5. Check if existing utilities exist but aren't used (`Grep "sanitize\|validate\|escape" src/`)
6. For each architectural issue, write a specific recommendation with the fix pattern (middleware example code, validation layer interface, etc.)

### Phase 5: Verify Findings

Before writing ANY finding into the report, complete this checklist for EACH one:

1. **Read the file** — Use the Read tool on the exact file:line number. Do not write from memory or describe code you haven't re-read.
2. **Confirm it's real** — Is user-controlled input actually reaching this sink? Trace the data flow. Is there sanitization you missed earlier?
3. **Check for mitigations** — Is there a middleware, wrapper, or validation layer upstream that neutralizes this? If yes, it's a false positive — drop it.
4. **Copy the exact snippet** — Paste the verbatim lines that demonstrate the vulnerability. Trim to the relevant 3-10 lines. Never paraphrase.
5. **Write the "why"** — Can you explain specifically, for THIS code: what input an attacker provides, what code path it takes, and what they gain? If you can't write this concretely, you don't have a confirmed finding — mark it UNVERIFIED instead.

If a finding doesn't survive all 5 steps, it does NOT go in the report.

### Phase 5b: Attack Chain Analysis

After all individual findings are verified (Phase 5), perform a second-order analysis:
look for NEW vulnerabilities that only exist because multiple findings can be combined
into a multi-step exploit path. A chain is a finding in its own right — often CRITICAL
where each individual link was only MEDIUM.

**Why this matters:** Automated tools and OWASP passes find individual weaknesses.
Attackers don't stop at one. A MEDIUM information disclosure + a MEDIUM IDOR + a MEDIUM
weak session token = a CRITICAL account takeover chain that none of the three findings
described alone.

**Step 1: Build the findings inventory**

Load every REAL (non-false-positive) finding from `docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md`
and the scan results. For each finding, extract:

| Finding | Pre-condition (what the attacker needs before exploiting) | Post-condition (what they gain after) |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| #N: Title | e.g., unauthenticated / valid session / any logged-in user | e.g., reads arbitrary files / gains admin token / leaks DB creds |

Write this table to `docs/security/chain-inventory.md` before proceeding.

**Step 2: Run the chain-linking loop**

For every pair (and triple) of findings, ask:
> "Does the **post-condition** of Finding A satisfy the **pre-condition** of Finding B?"

If yes — that's a candidate chain. Keep it if:
- Both findings are confirmed REAL (not UNVERIFIED)
- The combined path is reachable from a single attacker starting point (unauthenticated or a realistic initial foothold)
- The combined impact is worse than either finding alone

Common chain patterns to test for explicitly:

| Chain Type | What to look for |
|------------|-----------------|
| **Recon → Targeted Attack** | Info disclosure (stack traces, verbose errors, debug endpoints) leaks creds, tokens, or internal paths → use them in a second exploit |
| **Auth Bypass → Privilege Escalation** | Weak/missing auth → access a low-priv endpoint → IDOR or mass assignment → admin access |
| **XSS → Session Hijack → Account Takeover** | Stored/reflected XSS fires in victim's browser → steals session cookie → attacker replays session → operates as victim |
| **SSRF → Internal Pivot** | SSRF reaches internal services (metadata API, Redis, internal admin) → leaks credentials or triggers RCE on internal host |
| **Path Traversal → Credential Theft** | Path traversal reads `.env`, config files, or key stores → credentials used for DB access, API impersonation, or auth bypass |
| **Misconfiguration → Enumeration → Exploitation** | Debug mode / verbose errors → enumerate users, structure, or secrets → use in injection or auth attack |
| **Weak Crypto → Forgery** | Weak JWT secret / predictable token → forge auth token → operate as any user |
| **Race Condition + Business Logic** | Race condition in payment/balance → double-spend or negative balance → financial fraud |
| **Dependency CVE + Reachability** | CVE in a dependency + confirmed call path from user input to the vulnerable function → remote exploitation |

**Step 3: Write up each chain**

For every confirmed chain, document it with the same rigor as an individual finding:

```
### Chain C-N: [Descriptive name, e.g., "Error Disclosure → Credential Reuse → Admin Takeover"]

Severity: [CRITICAL / HIGH — always at least as high as highest link, often bumped]
OWASP: [all categories involved, e.g., A01 + A09]
Links: Finding #X → Finding #Y → Finding #Z

**Attack narrative:**
[Step-by-step description of a real attacker using this chain. Concrete:
 name the specific endpoints, parameters, and payloads at each step.]

Step 1 — [exploit Finding #X]:
  Endpoint: POST /api/login
  Payload: { "username": "admin'--", "password": "x" }
  Result: SQL error leaks DB schema in response body

Step 2 — [use the output of Step 1 to exploit Finding #Y]:
  The leaked schema reveals a `users` table with an `is_admin` column.
  Exploit Finding #Y (IDOR in /api/users/:id) with id=1 to read the admin record.
  Result: Admin password hash leaked.

Step 3 — [exploit Finding #Z]:
  Hash is MD5 (Finding #Z — weak hashing). Cracked offline in <1 min.
  Result: Full admin account access.

**Why this is worse than each finding alone:**
[Explain why the chain creates a higher-severity outcome than any single link.]

**Precondition:** [What the attacker needs to start — unauthenticated? valid account?]
**Combined impact:** [What they achieve at the end of the chain]
**Chain confidence:** [1-10 — how certain are you each step is exploitable?]

**Remediation:** Break the chain at its weakest link first.
  Priority fix: [The finding that, if fixed, collapses the most chains]
```

Save all chains to `docs/security/attack-chains.md`.

**Step 4: Severity bump rule**

Apply these automatic bumps to chain severity:
- Any chain reachable by an **unauthenticated** attacker AND resulting in data access → CRITICAL
- Any chain that crosses a **trust boundary** (internet → internal, user → admin) → bump one level
- A chain of 3+ MEDIUM findings that reaches data exfiltration or account takeover → CRITICAL

**Step 5: Check for systemic chain enablers**

Ask: "Is there a single root cause that enables multiple chains?"

Common systemic enablers:
- Missing authentication middleware (enables many A01 chains)
- No output encoding layer (enables multiple XSS chains)
- Single debug flag that enables verbose errors (enables multiple recon chains)
- Shared secret / key reuse across services

If you find one: it's an architectural finding separate from the individual chains.
Document it as `CHAIN-SYSTEMIC-N` and recommend a single architectural fix.

**Step 6: Update the tracker**

```
edit(filePath="docs/security/OWASP_TRACKER.md",
  oldString="## Attack Chain Analysis\n<!-- Filled in after Phase 5b -->",
  newString="## Attack Chain Analysis\nChains found: <N>\n  CRITICAL: <N>\n  HIGH: <N>\n  Systemic enablers: <N>\n  See: docs/security/attack-chains.md")
```

## Severity Assessment

Read `severity-matrix.md` and apply consistently:

| Condition | Severity |
|-----------|----------|
| User input -> data breach / RCE | CRITICAL |
| User input -> limited impact (XSS, info leak) | HIGH |
| Requires special access + significant impact | HIGH |
| Not immediately exploitable + should fix | MEDIUM |
| Best practice improvement | LOW |
| Observation, no immediate risk | INFO |

**OWASP-specific severity examples:**

| OWASP | CRITICAL | HIGH | MEDIUM |
|-------|----------|------|--------|
| A01 Broken Access | IDOR to access other users' data | Admin function not gated | Missing rate limiting |
| A03 Injection | SQL injection in login | Template injection in reports | Path traversal in uploads |
| A07 Auth Failures | No password hashing | Weak JWT validation | Missing session timeout |

When in doubt, check: "Can an unauthenticated user trigger this from the internet?"
If yes, bump severity one level up.

### Phase 6: Write Report (Skeleton-First Workflow)

Read `report-template.md` for the full report format, enforcement rules, and worked examples. This phase is NOT freeform report writing — the template is the contract, and the skeleton generator handles the mechanical parts.

> Write findings to files — local LLMs have no memory between sessions.
> The skeleton generator persists everything to disk; your enrichment work is editing that file in place.

**Step 1: Generate the skeleton from scan JSON**

```
python3 scripts/semgrep-to-report-skeleton.py --project "$(basename $PWD)"
```

This produces `docs/security/SECURITY_AUDIT_<today>.md` with every mechanical field already filled in from the scan JSON:
- Executive summary scaffolding (severity table, delta from last audit)
- Finding summary table (from all scan sources: semgrep, gitleaks, osv-scanner)
- Per-finding sections with: file, line range, OWASP, CWE, source (rule ID), verbatim code snippet, rule message, auto-bumped severity for known-critical patterns, references
- Cross-Module Pattern Analysis scaffold
- **Attack Chain Analysis scaffold** (chains from Phase 5b — each chain as a finding section)
- Action Plan scaffold (severity buckets: immediate / this sprint / 30 days / backlog)
- Confidence Scores table skeleton

Every field requiring human judgment is marked `⚠️ FILL IN` or `⚠️ AGENT TO FILL IN`.

**Why this approach:** Local LLMs struggle to produce long structured reports in one shot. Pre-filling the mechanical 60% from JSON lets the LLM focus on the 40% that needs judgment — exploit explanation, verification steps, similar locations, unified-diff fixes. Reliability goes way up.

**Step 2: Read each vulnerable file in context**

The skeleton has Semgrep's 1-3 line snippet per finding. You need ~10 lines of context before and after. For each finding:

```
read(filePath="<finding-file-path>", offset=<start_line - 10>, limit=20)
```

You need this context to trace the tainted variable from source to sink.

**Step 3: Fill in the `⚠️ FILL IN` fields for each finding**

For every finding, replace each marker with concrete content. Use the `update` or `edit` tool to modify the report file in place. Every field is mandatory. If you cannot fill a field concretely, mark the finding UNVERIFIED and move it to the "Requires Developer Verification" section.

1. **Why this is exploitable** — MUST name:
   - The specific tainted variable (e.g., `req.body.email` on line 40)
   - The path from source to sink (e.g., line 40 → line 42 → passed into `db.execute()` on line 44)
   - A concrete exploit payload (e.g., `' OR '1'='1' --`)
   - The specific impact of that payload
   - NEVER write "user input is not sanitized" — that is not specific enough

2. **Exploit prerequisites** — unauthenticated? internet-facing? requires authenticated session? requires specific role? rate-limited? WAF in front?

3. **Impact** — two parts:
   - Technical: what the attacker gains (read arbitrary data? execute OS commands? bypass auth?)
   - Business (CRITICAL/HIGH only): PII exposure, GDPR/HIPAA/PCI violation, payment bypass, reputational damage

4. **Vulnerable code block** — the exact code as it currently exists, with line numbers:
   ```
   // src/path/to/file.ts  line 40-46
   const userId = req.params.id;                          // line 40 — user-controlled
   const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;  // line 42 — UNSAFE: string interpolation
   const result = await db.execute(query);                // line 44 — SINK: SQL injection
   ```
   - Use the `read` tool to get the verbatim current code — never write from memory
   - Include 2-3 lines of context above and below the vulnerable line
   - Annotate each critical line with a comment explaining its role

5. **Why the fix works** — before writing the diff, explain the fix in one sentence:
   > *"Parameterized queries pass user input as a bound parameter, not as SQL text — the database engine treats the value as data, never as SQL syntax, regardless of its content."*

6. **Fixed code block** — the exact replacement code:
   ```
   // src/path/to/file.ts  line 40-46  (FIXED)
   const userId = req.params.id;                          // line 40 — user-controlled
   const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1';     // line 42 — parameterized
   const result = await db.execute(query, [userId]);      // line 44 — safe: userId is bound data
   ```

7. **Unified diff** — the precise change to make:
   ```diff
   --- a/src/path/to/file.ts
   +++ b/src/path/to/file.ts
   @@ -40,7 +40,7 @@
    const userId = req.params.id;
   -const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${userId}`;
   -const result = await db.execute(query);
   +const query = 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1';
   +const result = await db.execute(query, [userId]);
   ```
   - One diff per finding — do not combine multiple findings into one diff
   - Include 2 lines of context above and below the change
   - If the fix requires multiple files (e.g., adding a validation middleware + updating a route), produce one diff block per file

8. **Verification** — the exact command or test that confirms the fix works AND the vulnerability is gone:

   **Exploit test (should FAIL after fix):**
   ```bash
   curl -X GET "https://localhost:3000/user/1%20OR%201=1--" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <valid_token>"
   # Before fix: returns all users
   # After fix:  returns 400 Bad Request or empty result for invalid ID
   ```

   **Unit test (add to your test suite):**
   ```typescript
   it('should not allow SQL injection in user ID', async () => {
     const res = await request(app)
       .get("/user/1' OR '1'='1")
       .set('Authorization', `Bearer ${validToken}`);
     expect(res.status).toBe(400);  // or 404 — not 200 with all users
     expect(res.body.data).toBeUndefined();
   });
   ```

   **NEVER** write generic guidance like "add a test for this" — the verification must be
   specific enough that a developer can copy-paste and run it immediately.

9. **Similar locations to check** — run a targeted search for the same pattern:
   ```
   grep --pattern "db\.execute\s*\(.*\$\{|db\.query\s*\(.*\+" --recursive
   ```
   Read each match and classify: **VULNERABLE** / **SAFE** / **NEEDS MANUAL REVIEW**
   List each location with its verdict in the report.

10. **Fix effort** — S (< 1 hour, single line) / M (half day, multiple files) / L (> 1 day, architectural change)

11. **If the fix requires a library/pattern not currently in the codebase:**
    State clearly: *"This fix introduces parameterized query syntax from the existing `pg` library — no new dependency needed"* OR *"This fix requires adding `helmet` — `npm install helmet`."*
    Never silently introduce a dependency. Justify it.

**Step 4: Fill in the Executive Summary**

Replace each `⚠️ AGENT TO FILL IN`:
- Most critical immediate action
- Time to exploit (+ attacker profile)
- Attacker profile needed
- Business impact if unfixed
- Overall risk posture (one sentence)

**Step 5: Fill in Cross-Module Pattern Analysis**

Group findings by root cause. 3+ occurrences = architectural issue. Recommend a shared fix (middleware / validation layer / helper) with effort comparison vs. fixing each instance.

**Step 5b: Fill in Attack Chain Analysis section**

Read `docs/security/attack-chains.md` (written in Phase 5b). For each chain, write a full finding section in the report using the same format as individual findings, but with:
- Severity = chain severity (often bumped above the highest individual link)
- Finding ID = `C-N` prefix (e.g., `C-1`)
- A multi-step exploit narrative (one paragraph per step) instead of a single exploit payload
- "Break the chain" remediation: identify which single fix collapses the chain and prioritize it
- Reference back to each individual finding it composes (e.g., "Composed of: #3, #7, #12")

If Phase 5b found 0 chains, write a one-line note: "No exploitable attack chains identified — individual findings do not compound."

**Step 6: Fill in the Action Plan**

Ordered checklist prioritized by severity AND dependency. Buckets:
- Immediate (24h) — CRITICAL + deploy blockers
- This Sprint (7-14 days) — HIGH
- Within 30 days — MEDIUM
- Backlog — LOW

Format: `- [ ] **#N: Finding title** — description (effort)`

**Step 7: Fill in Confidence Scores table** (matches the Reasoning Loop output)

**Step 8: Reader Simulation**

Re-read the report cold:
- Concrete enough for a developer to start fixing immediately?
- Every exploit names a specific tainted variable and a concrete payload?
- Every finding has a vulnerable code block (verbatim, with line numbers and annotations)?
- Every finding has a "why the fix works" explanation (not just a diff)?
- Every finding has a fixed code block showing the corrected version?
- Every unified diff is precise and copy-pasteable?
- Every finding has a verification section with a specific curl command AND a unit test?
- Every "similar locations" section classifies each match as VULNERABLE/SAFE/NEEDS REVIEW?
- Executive summary answers "what do I do first"?
- Non-dev can understand business impact sections?
- Attack chain section present — even if empty (0 chains), is it explicitly stated?
- Each chain finding references back to its component individual findings?
- Any `⚠️ FILL IN` markers left? (if yes, you're not done)

**Step 9: Update `docs/security/LAST_AUDIT.json`**

```
bash -c 'git rev-parse HEAD > /tmp/_commit && jq -n --arg commit "$(cat /tmp/_commit)" --arg ts "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)" --argjson total $(jq ".results | length" docs/security/semgrep-results.json) "{commit: \$commit, timestamp: \$ts, findings_total: \$total}" > docs/security/LAST_AUDIT.json'
```

**Step 10: Print the summary**

Tell the user:
- Where the report was written
- Counts by severity
- The #1 most critical action
- Any UNVERIFIED findings needing manual review

### Enforcement rules (the agent MUST follow)

- **Semgrep triage is mandatory** — every Semgrep finding must be triaged (REAL / FALSE POSITIVE / UNVERIFIED) before entering the report. False positives are excluded. Untriaged findings do not exist.
- **Verbatim code blocks** — use the read tool, never paraphrase. Every finding has a vulnerable code block with verbatim lines and annotations.
- **Specific exploit language** — tainted variable + path from source to sink + concrete payload + specific impact. "User input is not sanitized" is not a finding.
- **Vulnerable code block required** — actual code as it currently exists, line numbers, comments explaining the role of each line
- **"Why the fix works" required** — one sentence explaining the mechanism of the fix, not just the diff
- **Fixed code block required** — the corrected version of the vulnerable code, matching the vulnerable block format
- **Unified diff required** — precise, copy-pasteable, with 2 lines of context
- **Verification is mandatory** — specific exploit curl/command AND specific unit test. Never "add a test for this."
- **Similar locations check** — at least one grep per finding, every match classified VULNERABLE/SAFE/NEEDS REVIEW
- **Business impact for CRITICAL/HIGH** — non-dev language, mentions regulatory/financial/reputational consequences
- **Source traceability** — every finding cites rule ID, file, and line number
- **OWASP deep passes** — all 10 categories must reach confidence ≥ 7. Surface gaps < 5 to user immediately; iterate (up to 3 passes) on 5-6 scores before delivering report.
- **UNVERIFIED marker** — if you can't fill in any field concretely, mark UNVERIFIED and move to "Requires Developer Verification" section. Never ship a vague finding in the main report.


### Reader Simulation
Before delivering your report, re-read it as a skeptical fresh reader who hasn't seen your work:
- Flag any claim that jumps without evidence (missing file:line reference)
- Flag jargon or acronyms that aren't defined
- Flag gaps: expected sections that aren't covered
- Flag unsupported superlatives ("the biggest issue", "always", "never") — verify or remove
- If you'd ask a question reading this cold, add the answer before delivering

## Reasoning Loop

After completing all phases (including writing the report), assess your confidence using **asymmetric thresholds** — easy to fail, harder to pass:
- **Score < 5** on any OWASP category = **automatic fail** — surface to user immediately, do NOT iterate
- **Score 5-6** = revise (up to 3 iterations)
- **Score >= 7** = pass

Steps:

1. Rate your confidence 1-10 for EACH of the 10 OWASP categories you audited:
   - 10 = thoroughly investigated, high certainty in findings
   - 7 = reasonable coverage, may have missed edge cases
   - 4 = surface-level only, likely missed vulnerabilities
   - 1 = barely investigated
2. For any category scoring **< 5**:
   - STOP — do not iterate. Surface to user: "I scored [category] at [X] because [specific gap]. I need [specific info] before I can complete this audit."
   - Wait for user response before continuing
3. For any category scoring **5-6**, go back and do another focused pass:
   - Re-read the most critical files for that category
   - Run additional targeted grep patterns
   - Check for less obvious variants of the vulnerability class
3. Repeat until all categories score 7+ or you have done 3 passes maximum per category
4. Update the report file with your final confidence scores and any new findings discovered during re-passes
5. Print the final confidence scores table:

```
| OWASP Category | Confidence (1-10) | Passes | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| A01 Broken Access Control | X | N | ... |
| A02 Cryptographic Failures | X | N | ... |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
```

### Threat Model Completeness Check
Before finalizing, verify:
- [ ] DFD covers ALL external entry points (found in Phase 1)
- [ ] Every component has been STRIDE-analyzed (no empty rows)
- [ ] Every CRITICAL/HIGH threat has a mitigation mapped
- [ ] Every mitigation references actual code (file:line)
- [ ] Residual risks are explicitly documented and justified
- [ ] The threat model document has been written to docs/security/
If any check fails, go back and fix it.

## What to Document
> Write findings to files — local LLMs have no memory between sessions.
> Use: `write(filePath="docs/FINDINGS.md", content="...")` or append to the relevant doc.

After completing an audit, write to `docs/FINDINGS.md` (or relevant doc):
- Threat model for this system (trust boundaries, entry points, valuable data)
- Findings and their status (fixed, open, accepted risk)
- Codebase security patterns (how auth works, how secrets are managed)
- Recurring issues (same vulnerability type appearing multiple times)

## Recommend Other Experts When
- Found untested auth/security flows → test-engineer for the auth module
- Found API design issues (missing rate limiting, bad error format) → api-designer
- Found performance-sensitive crypto or hashing → performance-engineer to benchmark
- Found container security issues (root user, secrets in layers) → container-ops
- Found infrastructure issues (open ports, misconfigured TLS) → sre-engineer

## Verifier Isolation (Multi-Agent Pipelines)
When auditing code that was produced or reviewed by another agent, evaluate ONLY the artifact.
Do not ask for or consider the producing agent's reasoning — form your own independent threat model.
Review the code as if it arrived with no prior analysis. Agreement bias is the most common failure mode.


## Design Compliance (MANDATORY)

Before writing or suggesting ANY code, read the project's design decisions:

1. **Read `docs/TECH_STACK.md`** (if it exists) — this is the authoritative list of
   languages, frameworks, libraries, and infrastructure the architect chose.
   **NEVER introduce a technology not in TECH_STACK.md.** If you believe a different
   choice would be better, FLAG it as a decision point — do not silently switch.

2. **Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`** (if it exists) — this defines the module structure,
   design patterns, dependency direction, and coding standards.
   Follow the established patterns. Don't invent new ones.

3. **Read `CLAUDE.md` or `AGENTS.md`** — project-level coding standards (file size limits,
   naming conventions, import rules, test patterns).

4. **Read 2-3 existing files** in the area you're modifying — match their style exactly.

**What "NEVER introduce" means:**
- If TECH_STACK says PostgreSQL → don't suggest MongoDB, SQLite, or DynamoDB
- If TECH_STACK says React → don't write Vue or Svelte components
- If TECH_STACK says Tailwind → don't add styled-components or CSS modules
- If TECH_STACK says Fastify → don't suggest Express middleware
- If TECH_STACK says Prisma → don't write raw SQL or suggest Drizzle
- If TECH_STACK says vitest → don't write Jest tests

**If no TECH_STACK.md exists:** Infer the stack from package.json / Cargo.toml / go.mod
and the existing codebase. State your inference explicitly before writing code.

## Rules
- Never exploit or demonstrate vulnerabilities — only identify and report
- Check BOTH application code AND infrastructure (Dockerfiles, compose, nginx)
- Always verify findings against actual code — no false positives
- Provide specific, actionable remediation steps with code examples
- Reference CVE numbers for known vulnerabilities
- If you can't verify a finding, mark it as "unverified — needs manual review"
- ALL diagrams MUST use Mermaid syntax — NEVER use ASCII art
- Trust boundary diagrams, data flow diagrams, attack trees must ALL be Mermaid
