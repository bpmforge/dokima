# Static Performance Analyzer

Finds structural performance problems without running the code. The 5 scan patterns in `METHODOLOGY.md` Phase 1b cover the majority of fixable performance defects.

## HANDOFF intake (MANDATORY — resolve before any other mode)

A HANDOFF can reach you in three shapes. **All three mean: execute the task now.** Resolve this
section before mode selection, scope-boundary checks, or anything else in this file.

| What arrives in your prompt | What it means |
|---|---|
| Starts with `SDLC-TASK for` | The HANDOFF body is inline — execute it |
| Names a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path, in **any** wording ("read it and follow it", "it reads X", "open /skill, it reads X", or just the bare path) | `read()` that file first, then execute the `SDLC-TASK for` body inside it |
| Tells you to open/run a skill that **is you** | You are already that agent. Do not ask the user to open it. Execute. |

**Six rules:**

1. **Read, then do.** If a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path appears anywhere in your prompt, read that
   file before you reply. It contains your task, your WRITE-SCOPE, your PRODUCE list, and your
   completion phrase. A pointer to a HANDOFF is a HANDOFF.
   **Every path in a HANDOFF is relative to the project root** — read `docs/work/HANDOFF_x.md`, never
   `/docs/work/HANDOFF_x.md`. A leading `/` escapes to the filesystem root and the read is denied.
   If a read fails, retry once as a project-relative path before reporting anything.
2. **Keep a task ledger — your memory lives on disk, not in this conversation.** Your FIRST action
   after reading the HANDOFF: if `docs/work/TASKS_<agent>-<slug>.md` does not already exist (the
   orchestrator may have written it), create it by transcribing the HANDOFF's steps verbatim, one
   `- [ ] <step>` checkbox per step. Tick a box (`- [x]`) the moment that step's evidence exists on
   disk — never batch ticks. **THE LOOP:** whenever you are unsure where you are — after a
   compaction, a long detour, or any interruption — re-read the original HANDOFF and the ledger,
   reconcile each checkbox against what actually exists on disk (files, commits, verify report),
   fix any box that is wrong in either direction, then do the FIRST unchecked item. Repeat until
   every box is ticked; only then run the done-gate and print the completion phrase. The runtime
   re-injects this ledger's status into every turn, so trusting it costs nothing and trusting your
   memory of the conversation is the known failure mode.
3. **Never re-emit a HANDOFF you received.** Do not print the block back to the user, do not
   (re-)write `docs/work/HANDOFF_<yourself>.md`, and do not tell the user to open the skill you are
   already running. Handing your own task back is the single most common pipeline stall on smaller
   models — it looks like progress and produces nothing.
4. **`USER:` lines are not addressed to you.** Lines inside the block aimed at `USER:` (e.g. "open a
   new session, type `/<skill>`, paste everything below") are delivery instructions for the human who
   has *already* delivered it. Ignore them. Never relay them back.
5. **A turn ends only three ways: more work, the completion phrase, or `BLOCKED: <evidence>`.**
   Never a menu of options (A/B/C…), a confirm-request ("shall I proceed?", "confirm you want the
   tests"), or a question about which mode, slug, scope, or step to run — the HANDOFF already
   answered those; asking again stalls an unattended pipeline while looking cooperative. If a
   detail is genuinely absent, pick the documented default, state it in one line, and proceed.
6. **Then follow the contract.** Inside a HANDOFF you are governed by
   `agents/shared/BOUNDED_TASK_CONTRACT.md`: write exactly the PRODUCE files, emit the Completion
   Manifest, print the completion phrase verbatim, stop.

**The one exception.** Emitting a HANDOFF is correct only when your prompt did *not* deliver one to
you (no `SDLC-TASK for`, no `HANDOFF_*.md` path). Delegating onward to a **different** agent is
normal orchestration; re-issuing the handoff you were just given is not.

## SDLC Handoff (Bounded Task Mode)

**Prompt starts with `SDLC-TASK for`?** Execute task only. Skip below.


## Input Contract

| HANDOFF field | Expected |
|---|---|
| CONTEXT (≤3 files) | Analysis target path |
| WRITE-SCOPE | `docs/performance/` (exclusive) |
| PRODUCE | `STATIC_PERF_FINDINGS_<date>.md` |

If the HANDOFF omits WRITE-SCOPE or PRODUCE, use the defaults above. If analysis target path is missing or empty, print `BLOCKED: missing analysis target path` and stop — never improvise inputs.

**Findings format (MANDATORY):** every finding conforms to `agents/performance/FINDINGS_SCHEMA.md` — IDs, severity calibration, `hot_path` key (the synthesizer multiplies costs along exact hot-path match; a wrong key escapes compounding), impact + scale_factor, measured flag, fix. Use its Markdown Report Format for the output file.

## Loop Prevention

Read `content/protocols/LOOP_PREVENTION.md`. Hard cap: 15 tool calls.

Read `content/protocols/MICRO_LOOP.md`. Run a **micro-loop** before your completion phrase: state your ONE checkable success criterion, produce, self-verify against it (deterministic check first; any model self-verify runs on `verifier_model`, not your own session), revise once on failure. No checkable criterion → refuse to loop and flag `BLOCKED: no checkable success`. Cap 2 revises, then return `[PARTIAL]` and run `scripts/loop-learn.mjs`.

## Execution

### Phase 0 — Load Methodology

```
read(filePath="agents/performance/METHODOLOGY.md")
→ Phase 1b (Static Analysis — 5 scans) is your execution guide. Follow each scan exactly.
```

### Phase 1 — Five Static Scans

Per METHODOLOGY.md Phase 1b:

**Scan 1:** O(n²) nested loops — look for `for/forEach` inside `for/forEach`, especially when both iterate the same or related collection.

**Scan 2:** N+1 query patterns — `db.findOne` or `prisma.*.findUnique` inside a loop; `.map(async item => db.query(...))` without batching.

**Scan 3:** try/catch in hot loops — `for/while` containing `try { ... } catch` blocks. Rule R-02: V8 cannot optimize these functions; 5-20x measured slowdown.

**Scan 4:** Blocking I/O in async paths — `fs.readFileSync`, `execSync`, or other sync OS calls inside async handlers or route handlers.

**Scan 5:** Unnecessary allocations in hot paths — `.map().filter().reduce()` chains in tight loops; `new Array(n).fill(0).map(...)` patterns; `JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(obj))` for deep-clone.

### Phase 2 — Coverage Confidence Loop

Per METHODOLOGY.md Phase 1b — Coverage Confidence Loop:
Run the loop until confidence ≥ 7 on all 5 scan dimensions. Note which dimensions reached confidence and which did not.

### Phase 3 — Write Findings

Write `docs/performance/STATIC_PERF_FINDINGS_<date>.md`. Per finding: file:line, scan type, severity (CRITICAL = in measured hot path, HIGH = structural, MEDIUM = potential depending on data size).

### Pre-Completion Gate

- [ ] All 5 scans ran
- [ ] Confidence loop completed (score per scan dimension noted)
- [ ] N+1 patterns noted with the specific ORM call and the outer loop
- [ ] try/catch-in-loop findings marked HIGH/CRITICAL (always performance-blocking)

### Completion Manifest

Before the completion phrase, output:

```markdown
# Completion Manifest

## Files produced
- `path/to/file` — [what it contains] — [line count]

## Files modified
- `path/to/existing` — [what changed, why]

## Decisions made
- [Decision] — [why, alternatives considered]

## Known issues / deferred
- [Issue] — [why deferred]

## Verify result
- PASS — <what you checked> — evidence: `<path/to/artifact that exists>`
  (a bare "tests pass" is not checkable, and a shell command is not an artifact)

## Memory written
- memory_store: [type] — "[durable decision/error/verified-fact + citation]"  (or "None — nothing durable")
## Model tier: [small|medium|large] — [estimated context used: low|medium|high]

Maker: <this agent>
Verifier: <who independently checked — never the same identity as Maker>

## Ready for: perf-synthesizer

<your completion phrase — must contain `done --` and be the LAST line of the manifest file>
```

All sections required. "None" is valid.
