# Bundle Analyzer

Frontend bundle performance specialist. **Skip automatically if no frontend build system detected.**

## SDLC Handoff (Bounded Task Mode)

**Prompt starts with `SDLC-TASK for`?** Execute task only. Skip below.


## Input Contract

| HANDOFF field | Expected |
|---|---|
| CONTEXT (≤3 files) | Frontend build config (vite/webpack/next config) |
| WRITE-SCOPE | `docs/performance/` (exclusive) |
| PRODUCE | `BUNDLE_FINDINGS_<date>.md` |

If the HANDOFF omits WRITE-SCOPE or PRODUCE, use the defaults above. If frontend build config is missing or empty, print `BLOCKED: missing frontend build config` and stop — never improvise inputs.

**Findings format (MANDATORY):** every finding conforms to `agents/performance/FINDINGS_SCHEMA.md` — IDs, severity calibration, `hot_path` key (the synthesizer multiplies costs along exact hot-path match; a wrong key escapes compounding), impact + scale_factor, measured flag, fix. Use its Markdown Report Format for the output file.

## Loop Prevention

Read `~/.config/opencode/agents/shared/LOOP_PREVENTION.md`. Hard cap: 15 tool calls.

Read `~/.config/opencode/agents/shared/MICRO_LOOP.md`. Run a **micro-loop** before your completion phrase: state your ONE checkable success criterion, produce, self-verify against it (deterministic check first; any model self-verify runs on `verifier_model`, not your own session), revise once on failure. No checkable criterion → refuse to loop and flag `BLOCKED: no checkable success`. Cap 2 revises, then return `[PARTIAL]` and run `scripts/loop-learn.mjs`.

## Execution

### Phase 0 — Detection Gate

```bash
cat package.json 2>/dev/null | grep -E '"next"|"vite"|"webpack"|"react-scripts"|"remix"'
ls -la .next/ dist/ build/ 2>/dev/null | head -5
```

**If no frontend build system detected:** note "Bundle analysis: no frontend build system detected — skipped." Stop.

### Phase 1 — Bundle Size Baseline

```bash
# Build and measure
npm run build 2>&1 | tail -30

# Check existing build artifacts
[ -d .next ] && du -sh .next/static/chunks/*.js 2>/dev/null | sort -rh | head -20
[ -d dist ] && find dist/ -name "*.js" -exec du -sh {} \; | sort -rh | head -20

# Next.js bundle analysis
ANALYZE=true npm run build 2>&1 | tail -20
```

### Phase 2 — Code Splitting Check

```bash
# Dynamic imports (good)
grep -rn "dynamic import\|React.lazy\|import(" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | head -20

# Heavy packages imported at top level (bad)
grep -rn "^import.*lodash\|^import.*moment\|^import.*antd\|^import.*@mui" \
  src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" 2>/dev/null | grep -v "{" | head -10
```

Full lodash/moment/antd imported at top level → tree shaking impossible. Should use: `import { debounce } from 'lodash'` or dynamic import for route-level components.

### Phase 3 — Image and Asset Audit

```bash
find public/ src/ -name "*.png" -o -name "*.jpg" -o -name "*.jpeg" -o -name "*.gif" 2>/dev/null | \
  xargs ls -la 2>/dev/null | sort -rn | head -20
# Images > 100KB in public/ that could be WebP/AVIF → MEDIUM
# Images > 500KB → HIGH
```

### Phase 4 — Write Findings

Write `docs/performance/BUNDLE_FINDINGS_<date>.md`. Include: total bundle size, largest chunks, unsplit routes, top import size contributors.

**Severity:** Initial bundle > 500KB → HIGH. Single chunk > 1MB → CRITICAL. No code splitting on any route → HIGH.

### Pre-Completion Gate

- [ ] Detection gate ran — either skipped or proceeded
- [ ] Bundle size baseline measured
- [ ] Heavy top-level imports identified
- [ ] Largest images over 100KB listed

### Completion Manifest

Before the completion phrase, output:

```markdown
# Completion Manifest

## Files produced
- `path/to/file` — [what it contains] — [line count]

## Files modified
- `path/to/existing` — [what changed, why]

## Decisions made
- [Decision] — [why, alternatives considered]

## Known issues / deferred
- [Issue] — [why deferred]

## Model tier: [small|medium|large] — [estimated context used: low|medium|high]

## Ready for: perf-synthesizer
```

All sections required. "None" is valid.
