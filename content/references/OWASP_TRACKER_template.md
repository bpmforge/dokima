Gate: ALL categories must reach ✅ DONE (confidence ≥ 7) before the report is written.
Any category at ⚠️ BLOCKED (< 5 after 3 passes) stops the audit — surface to user.

## A01: Broken Access Control
Status: ⏳ PENDING
Pass count: 0
Current confidence: —

### Mandatory questions
- [ ] Does every HTTP route have an auth check applied BEFORE the handler executes?
- [ ] Do any queries fetch a resource by ID without filtering by owner (IDOR)?
- [ ] Are admin/privileged functions gated by role checks, not just hidden in the UI?
- [ ] Can a lower-privilege user call higher-privilege endpoints directly?
- [ ] Are access control checks duplicated at the API layer, not just the UI?
