# MICRO_LOOP.md — micro-agents running micro-loops

**The architecture in one line:** the system is **micro-agents arranged in macro-loops, and every micro-agent runs its own bounded micro-loop.** Two nested levels, the same five guarantees at each.

```
MACRO LOOP  (orchestrator, RALPH_WIGGUM_LOOP / FIX_VERIFY_LOOP)
  ├─ micro-agent A ── MICRO LOOP ── produce → self-verify → revise (≤cap) → return
  ├─ micro-agent B ── MICRO LOOP ── produce → self-verify → revise (≤cap) → return
  └─ micro-agent C ── MICRO LOOP ── produce → self-verify → revise (≤cap) → return
        (run in parallel; orchestrator scores returns, re-dispatches gaps)
```

The macro loop owns **coverage** (is every inventory row covered?). The micro-loop owns **correctness of one artifact** (is this one thing actually right before I return it?). Without micro-loops the orchestrator carries all the iteration; with them, each agent returns work that already passed its own checkable gate — the macro loop converges far faster.

## Shared includes (read once per session, not per loop iteration)

Every agent that runs a micro-loop reads these seven short blocks from `agents/shared/includes/` — brief, field-tested prompt steering rather than exhaustive scaffolding. They're referenced here rather than duplicated so a single edit updates every loop agent that loads this file:

| Include | Governs |
|---|---|
| `progress-grounding.md` | Never report a status word without pointing at this turn's tool-result evidence — the direct fix for the Manifest Honesty / gamed-selftest failure mode. |
| `autonomy-end-turn-check.md` | Before ending a turn: is the last paragraph a plan/promise instead of finished work? If so, do it now. |
| `anti-overengineering.md` | Don't add scope, abstraction, or defensive code beyond what the unit requires. |
| `boundaries.md` | Assessment (free) vs. action (needs the precondition actually verified first) — the general principle behind AUTONOMY_PROTOCOL.md and SCOPE_BOUNDARY.md. |
| `act-dont-overplan.md` | When you have enough information to act, act — don't re-derive, re-litigate, or narrate options you won't take. |
| `freshness-epistemic.md` | Any volatile claim (API, version, price, model name) is checked against a live source this session, not recalled from training data. |
| `cli-tools-present.md` | Check what's actually installed on this host before assuming a tool is or isn't available, and prefer the sharper tool once you know. |

## The micro-loop contract (every specialist HANDOFF)

A specialist does NOT return its first draft. It runs this internal loop before printing its completion phrase — a **numbered stage plan, each stage naming its expected output before that stage starts** (fable-mode discipline, source: `docs/research/FABLE5_FIELD_REPORTS.md` §6.1, in bpm-agent-amplifier — community-distilled Fable-style prompting that independently converged on this same shape):

```
1. CRITERION  — restate the ONE checkable success criterion for this artifact,
                AND its expected output — the concrete thing step 5 must hand
                back (a file at a path, a passing command, a written tracker
                row). If none exists, STOP — refuse to loop (see § Refuse-to-loop).
                For CODE, the criterion also includes: every file ≤ size cap,
                every external API verified, anti-slop clean (validate-code-health
                exit 0).
1b. PLAN-SHAPE — (code only) if the unit would exceed the file-size cap, design the
                book-style split UP FRONT — an index/barrel + chapter modules, one
                concern each — BEFORE producing. Never write a monolith you intend to
                refactor later (small models botch the extraction). See
                CODE_BOOK_PROTOCOL.md.
2. PRODUCE    — make the artifact (maker step).
2a. EVIDENCE  — before judging, if you cannot verify a claim about the code/artifact
                from what you have ALREADY seen, do not guess — LOOK. Up to 4 evidence
                actions per criterion (grep / read the specific lines / run the named
                validator or test). Cite what you found. Evidence actions do NOT count
                against the ≤2 revise cap — looking is not revising. One-shot recall
                loses to agentic exploration on weak models; this is the positive
                "go look" rule that balances the negative guards below.
3. SELF-VERIFY— run the criterion. **The check must be FAILABLE — capable of
                 actually returning FAIL, not a mental "looks right" pass. If the
                 stage failed, the check must catch it** (fable-mode: "the check
                 must fail if the stage did"):
                 - **deterministic / tool-offloaded first (B3):** if a validator,
                   test, grep, build, or tool CAN decide the criterion, the model
                   MUST NOT judge it — route to the tool. A weak model's own
                   judgment is its weakest link; offloading verification to tools is
                   the single most reliable lift (a 1B + tools can beat an 8B).
                 - **(code) lint-on-edit:** after EACH file edit, immediately run the
                   cheapest project check on the touched file (`tsc --noEmit` /
                   `py_compile` / the configured linter); fix once with the error, then
                   proceed. On small tier, never batch edits across files before the
                   first check — per-edit feedback is a model-sized lever (SWE-agent).
                 - only if NO tool can decide it: judge on `verifier_model`, in a
                   cleared sub-context, never grading your own reasoning in place —
                   and be a SKEPTIC, not a rubber stamp: flag ONLY a confirmed
                   problem you have an evidence action for. **Absence of evidence
                   that something is wrong is NOT itself a finding** (fable-mode) —
                   don't invent a gap just to look thorough.
4. REVISE     — if the criterion fails: first **RE-GROUND (B4)** — restate the goal
                and the one specific current-state-vs-goal gap in a single line —
                THEN fix that cited gap and go to step 3. Re-grounding each revision
                counters drift (small models drift ~20–25× more than frontier) and is
                the biggest measured weak-model lift; never just retry blindly.
4b. TRACK     — (G-D) before EXIT, record this unit in the tracker / PROGRESS /
                inventory / DELEGATION_LOG row. A step is NOT done until its work
                is written down — this is what stops things getting lost between
                steps and sessions. Gate: `validate-tracker-fresh.sh` must pass
                (work files changed ⇒ a tracker changed) and the Completion
                Manifest carries a `Tracker updated: <file>` line.
5. EXIT       — criterion passes  → return with Completion Manifest + phrase
                cap reached / stalled → return [PARTIAL] + escalation note + loop-learn
```

**Bounds (non-negotiable — these are why a micro-loop is safe to run unattended):**

| Guard | Rule | Reuses |
|-------|------|--------|
| **Cap** | ≤ 2 revise iterations inside a micro-loop (3 is a macro-loop budget; a micro-loop that needs 3 should return PARTIAL and let the orchestrator re-scope). | RALPH cap |
| **Checkable exit** | The criterion must be objectively decidable. No binary pass/fail ⇒ do not loop. | G7 refuse-to-loop |
| **Independent verify** | Deterministic check preferred; model self-verify runs on `verifier_model`, not the maker session. | G1 maker/verifier |
| **No-progress kill** | If the same gap survives a revision (gap unchanged), stop — don't burn the second iteration. | G2 gap-checksum |
| **Learn on exit-without-success** | On PARTIAL/stall, run `scripts/loop-learn.mjs` so the same miss isn't repeated. | G3 loop-learn |

---

## Refuse-to-loop (the most important rule)

A micro-loop with no checkable criterion is not a loop — it's an unbounded spend (Osmani's "loopmaxxing"). Before step 2, the agent must name its criterion from this menu:

- a `validate-*.sh` / `fix-verify.mjs` result,
- a test that references the artifact,
- a build / lint / smoke that must pass,
- a `grep` whose presence/absence is the proof (e.g. "no `query.*\+.*req` remains").

If the task's "done" is genuinely subjective (taste, wording, "make it nicer") with no measurable target → **return immediately, flag `BLOCKED: no checkable success`, route to a human.** Looping cannot converge on a goal it cannot evaluate.

---

## Which loop is which (don't nest the wrong thing)

| Level | Loop | Owner | Cap | Question it answers |
|-------|------|-------|-----|---------------------|
| Macro | RALPH_WIGGUM_LOOP | orchestrator | 3 (2 for feature/improve) | Is every inventory row covered? |
| Macro | FIX_VERIFY_LOOP | orchestrator | 3 | Are all CRITICAL/HIGH findings closed? |
| **Micro** | **this contract** | **the specialist itself** | **2** | Is this one artifact correct before I return it? |

A micro-loop never spawns sub-agents (one level of orchestration only — opencode #9280). A micro-loop never re-scans for new work — it verifies the ONE artifact it owns. Cross-artifact coverage is always the macro loop's job.

**Refuse-to-select-next-work (T26.3).** The macro loop's own "what's next" step (`/reflow claim`,
`run-until-done.sh` starting another session) is gated the same way a micro-loop's checkable
criterion is: a red hygiene validator (`validate-tickets.sh`/`validate-state-drift.sh`) or an
actor's still-open previous ticket (claimed/in_progress, no `close()` receipt yet) refuses
selection outright — `scripts/lib/tickets.mjs claim`/`open-for` and `run-until-done.sh`'s
`next_work_gate_ok()` enforce this in code, not just prose (see `PERSISTENCE.md`'s "Persistence ≠
selecting new work over a red gate"). Treat that refusal like a failed checkable criterion: report
it, don't work around it.

---

## Why two levels and not one

- **Cheaper convergence.** An agent that returns self-verified work means the orchestrator's score is usually ≥7 on the first return — fewer macro re-dispatches.
- **Bounded blast radius.** A micro-loop that stalls returns PARTIAL and dies; it can't spin the whole pipeline.
- **Honest verification.** The independent-verifier rule at the micro level stops the maker from rubber-stamping itself before the orchestrator ever sees it — the over-report is caught one layer earlier.
- **Composability.** Same five guarantees at both levels means one mental model, and the same tooling (`run-coverage-loop.sh`, `fix-verify.mjs`, `loop-learn.mjs`, `verifier_model`) serves both.

This is the shape Foreman runs unattended: a tree of micro-agents, each self-verifying in a micro-loop, wrapped in macro coverage/fix loops, gated by validators, with budgets and a human approval queue at the irreversible edges.
