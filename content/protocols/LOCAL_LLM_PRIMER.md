# Local LLM Session Primer

## Session rules (active for this entire conversation)

**Rule 1 — SDLC-TASK overrides everything.**
If you receive a prompt starting with `SDLC-TASK for <agent>:`, ignore all other sections of your agent file. Execute ONLY: read CONTEXT → run YOUR TASK → write Completion Manifest → print completion phrase → stop.
**A pointer to a HANDOFF is a HANDOFF.** If your prompt names a `docs/work/HANDOFF_*.md` path in any wording, read that file and execute the `SDLC-TASK for` body inside it. Never re-emit a HANDOFF you were given, and never tell the user to open the skill you are already running.

**Rule 2 — HANDOFF blocks use ════ delimiters.**
Every delegation block looks like this — do not use `---` or any other separator. Nothing addressed to the user goes *inside* the delimiters; the specialist reads this body as its task:
```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
HANDOFF #N → <agent>  |  run by: <agent> via /<skill>
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
SDLC-TASK for <agent>:
...
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
END HANDOFF #N
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

**Rule 3 — No task() calls.**
Delegation is always a HANDOFF block. Execute it per `agents/shared/EXECUTOR_SELECTION.md` — in `autonomy=interactive` (default) print it for the user to copy into a new session; only in `autonomy=auto` dispatch via the Task tool / subprocess.

**Rule 4 — Write to disk immediately.**
Whenever you produce content > 200 tokens (code, a document, research findings), write it to disk with `write(filePath="...")` before continuing. Do not accumulate large outputs in context.

**Rule 5 — Stop means stop.**
After printing a completion phrase, your response ends. No summary, no follow-up, no "let me know if you need anything." The next word after the phrase is nothing.

**Rule 6 — Context budget.**
You have approximately [USER: fill in your model's context size] tokens total. Agent instructions use ~8-15k. Reserve the rest for your work. If you feel "full" (can't recall something from earlier), stop and write what you have to disk before continuing.

## Quick reference

| Situation | What to do |
|-----------|-----------|
| Prompt starts with `SDLC-TASK for` | Skip to Bounded Task Mode — 5 steps only |
| Need to delegate to another agent | Write a HANDOFF block with ════ delimiters |
| Generated a document or code | `write(filePath="...", content="...")` immediately |
| Not sure what the next step is | Read `docs/work/sdlc-state.md` first |
| Session getting long / feeling confused | Write current state to disk, user restarts with state file |
| Completed a SDLC-TASK | Completion Manifest → exact phrase → nothing else |
| Tool calls failing / empty `{}` args / "does not support tools" | It's almost always the runtime, not the model — see `references/local-agentic-models.md` (`--jinja`, Qwen3-Coder XML, strip `<think>`, late-2025 llama.cpp build) |
